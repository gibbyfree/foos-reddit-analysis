Supreme Court rules workers can't be fired for being gay or transgender,9,fux7kly,"I have to wonder if this Supreme Court decision now overturns these guidelines. I mean the Court now says it's a Title VII that you can't discriminate against for being gay or trans. Healthcare should be bound by Title VII as well.

Now for my conspiracy theory....

I had been wondering why they released these new guidelines while the Supreme Court was considering this case. It didn't make any sense to release new guidelines when they might be overturned as soon as the Supreme Court releases their decision. Now that this has happened so quickly after the guidelines were released I REALLY think it was done on purpose.

If Trump's people got a heads up that this was the court's decision (those papers take time to write) then they could have scrambled and gotten their healthcare guidelines out FIRST as a sort of dogwhistle for his followers. The sort of thing they want to show that they're there to discriminate against the gays and trans and get it out there before the Supreme Court makes that guideline impossible to follow.",1

Supreme Court rules workers can't be fired for being gay or transgender,18,fux91ys,">It's looking more and more like Kavanaugh will just be another mindless hard-right conservative justice who pretty much always votes the same way.

I'm sorry, do people just pay zero attention to the very public voting records of justices? Sure, time, cnn, etc. all ran scare pieces on how Kavanaugh was *going* to shift the court right, how he was going to overturn roe v wade, etc etc. 

Kavanaugh's Martin-Quinn score was .4 at the beginning as of 2020. That made him the *least* conservative justice out of all republican appointed justices, including Roberts at .43. For reference, 0 would be a neutral justice, and Alito scored 1.74, Thomas 3.09, and Gorsuch 1.22. On the Dem appointed side, the closest score to zero was Breyer at -1.7, with Sotomayor at -3.28, RBG at -2.9, Kagan at -1.8.

It's absolute garbage to say Kavanaugh is a mindless hard-right conservative given his voting record for the 2019 term was the **least** conservative, and **most** nuanced.

It's a lot faster to read through one that's already marked.

Finally, a lot of reaction to this story is from people who went through school in systems with grades that were more inflated than they were in 1982. (I was in college myself at the time.)

Supreme Court rules workers can't be fired for being gay or transgender,14,fuxdxho,"Counter argument: it’s nearly impossible to pass an amendment now, particularly given current political partisanship. Congress must first agree on and approve the text of a proposed amendment by a 2/3 majority in both houses (or we can call a constitutional convention, which is even more unlikely); the amendment is then sent to the states and must be approved (ratified) 3/4 of the states, either by he state legislatures, or in state ratifying conventions. As you can see, achieving ratification would require a very high degree of concurrence throughout the United States, not only among the population, but also among elected officials (who often have more extreme views or cater to corporate/special interests).

In the last 50 years, 3 Constitutional Amendments have been proposed: (1) lowering the voting age to 18; (2) the Equal Rights Amendment; and (3) the DC Voting Rights Amendment, which would have given DC congressional representation. Only the first of these has been ratified and is an accepted part of the Constitution - the age change was prompted by the Vietnam war, and the general feeling that if young men could go fight and die for their country, they should be able to vote. The ERA (equal rights for women) was recently ratified by Virginia, thus becoming the requisite 38th state to ratify. However, the original bill putting the amendment up for ratification had an expiration date and the final ratifications were after the expiration. In addition, several states have voted to “revoke” their ratification, though it is unclear whether the revocation is legally binding in such a case. In any case, the status of the ERA is currently legally challenged and seems unlikely to be adopted any time soon.

You could argue that amendments should only be made when the population is in agreement on the matter, and indeed that seems to have been the framers’ intent. But current politics often favor interests of small groups over the views of the majority. For instance, polls show that most Americans favor common sense gun reforms such as requiring background checks and banning bump stocks. Yet we never manage to get even basic reform laws passed in Congress… because lawmakers back away when the NRA and gun manufacturers start complaining. So unless we find an issue that requires a constitutional amend,ent that is of such obvious clarity that no one disagrees (and seriously, have you looked around lately? people disagree on the craziest, most stupid shit), we almost certainly won’t see any new amendments in our lifetimes.",1

Arizona Senator John McCain has passed away at the age of 81,180,e4uelcx,"Since you've volunteered the info of your profession, here's a question (though someone working hospice may be better suited to answer this): 

If there's no chance of improvement, and no quality of life to be eked out in remaining days, to the point that the patient is essentially laying there waiting to die - well, I've heard the term 'snowballing', where pain meds just start being given without concern for possible side effect of death. How does one... ask for that? *Can* you ask for that?


I watched my great grandfather drag on for half a year in pain (at the age of 103) and by the last few days, he was crying because he wanted to die so much, and the pain was so bad. He was pretty much mostly blind and deaf, with most of his memory gone at the end. He was only alive because there was no legal way for him to end things.

Edit: based on the responses, at the very very end (as in last week of his life) it seems like he was getting 'comfort care'. He wasn't conscious much because of the medication, but it was preferable to him being awake and in pain from the feeling of his body lying in a heavily padded bed. ",1

My friend was literally in this exact situation. I met her when she was 38, she told me one day at work that she was down because her husband had threatened to hit her. As someone with a past of abuse, I gently pushed for details to try and see how bad it was and if I could help her. Turns out the prick had been abusing her since she was 16 (legal age for sex and choice to leave the home here). He was 20 and convinced her that they were ment to be together and to move out so they could get married and start a life...

She told me that it only took him 2 weeks before he hit her for the first time. Over the course of 22 years she had a medical history sheet like you wouldnt believe, had 3 kids that she kept shielded from his wrath and sickeningly, multiple miscarriages due to the abuse.

He was a cop though and well liked in the smallish community, she told me she tried to run several times before her kids were born and he always found her, or other cops found her and brought her back to him. Then once her kids were born he would tell her that if she left he would find them, tie them together in the house and burn the place down. Really horrific shit.

Convinced her to get out, wrote my phone number down on a peice of paper, since he would read her phone and delete new numbers, and made her put it in the folds of her purse fabric. After a few weeks I ended up leaving that job (just a temp) and about 3 months later she finally messaged me to tell me that she and her kids had gotten free. Turns out since she couldnt go to the cops about it she had to go through an illegal womans refuge and relocation, as taking children away from thier father without proper reason can get them taken back.

 cases of petition fraud like this are included in ""voter fraud"" numbers (edit: apparently to inflate them.)

Even with this addition, total vote fraud cases for 2018 totalled 1290, out of around 100,000,000. 

Of all things the [heritage foundation compiles these](https://www.heritage.org/voterfraud) and lists the charges by each state, look at them, most are offenses of this nature. It's ironic that thier own list contradicts thier claim of ""swelling numbers"" 

Another interesting tidbit:

many of the individual actual voter fraud cases are committed by Republicans who are driven by the exaggeration of fraud to ""counter"" what they Percieve as inevitable despite overwhelming contrary evidence.

[Like this case](https://www.wftv.com/news/local/lake-county/investigation-underway-after-lake-county-election-officials-receive-fraudulent-voter-applications/6K6DKCUR45EKBKR66WSBH3HYEY/) where a woman, possibly a group investigators believe, changed nearly 120 voter registrations from Democrat to Republican by falsifying information.

It appears that fear mongering about voter fraud is more of a cause of it then the actual fraud itself.

Edit 2: if you review the list, you'll notice that not only are a vast majority not actual vote fraud, but didn't even occur on 2018 as the heading claims, from what I've reviewed there are cases as far back as 2002 on this list.

>There are other factors researchers have identified as impacting police violence rates. More racial segregation predicts more police violence (https://bu.edu/sph/2018/02/05/police-shootings-reflect-structural-racism/). **So does receiving military weapons from the feds** (https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/full/10.1177/1065912918784209
).

>Despite the US govt’s unwillingness to track police violence, we now have comprehensive data on killings by police via WaPo, http://mappingpoliceviolence.org & http://fatalencounters.org. While we don’t have enough data on non-fatal violence, we can learn a lot from the data we *do* have...

>When we break down the data by city, there are massive differences in police violence rates per population. St Louis, OKC and Orlando consistently have the highest rates of police violence. Killings are 3x less frequent in SF or Philly, 4x less in Detroit. http://mappingpoliceviolence.org/cities

>Who’s impacted by this violence? Black and brown people. This chart shows the race of unarmed people killed by police in major cities from 2013-19. Almost everyone was Black or Latinx. Black people are 3x more likely than whites to be killed by police & more likely to be unarmed.

>Among places that reduced police shootings, SF, Philly, Chicago, Denver, San Jose, LA, Phoenix and Baltimore made their use of force policies more restrictive during this period. Many had DOJ investigations. & many reformed enforcement of drugs/low level crime, reducing arrests.

>This is consistent with previous research finding departments with more restrictive use of force policies (http://useofforceproject.org) and DOJ interventions predict reduced police violence. Despite this, the Trump admin has stopped these DOJ investigations. https://vice.com/en_us/article/kznagw/jeff-sessions-is-walking-away-from-the-best-way-to-reduce-police-shootings

>Importantly, cities that reduced police shootings did so regardless of levels of crime. Crime rates (including violent crime rates) actually went up slightly in major cities during this period - but police shootings declined consistently with a 41% reduction during this time.

>On the other hand, having more Black officers is NOT associated with reducing police violence in most studies (some studies suggest more women on the force can help tho). Implicit bias training also hasn’t been shown to make a real difference. But a factor that DOES matter is...

>THE ACCOUNTABILITY SYSTEM. Just as some depts have higher violence rates, some officers have higher violence rates too. In Columbus, 6% of officers commit 50% of all use of force. When the system fails to hold them accountable it causes MAJOR problems...

>See now we can track how police misconduct spreads. And officers in close proximity to officers who have records of misconduct end up being 4x more likely to use force & 5x more likely to shoot someone. We can *contact trace* police violence like a virus. https://theintercept.com/2018/08/16/chicago-police-misconduct-social-network/

>Accountability systems work if they intervene & remove officers BEFORE misconduct spreads/escalates. But only 7% of excessive force complaints are upheld/result in discipline and 1% of killings result in prosecution. So these officers remain on the force. https://stories.usatodaynetwork.com/data_stories/police-use-of-force-data-a-huge-mess-across-the-u-s/

>Here too, data helps us understand how to increase accountability and decrease police violence. Misconduct complaints are more likely to be upheld when depts have body cams (video=key) but much less likely to be upheld in depts with police union contracts. https://gothamgazette.com/city/9167-initial-report-shows-benefits-and-challenges-of-nypd-body-camera-program-for-watchdog-agency

>This is because police union contracts are where the accountability system is set. Most contracts purge misconduct records, restrict misconduct investigations and help officers overturn discipline and get reinstated after being fired for misconduct. http://checkthepolice.org

>In fact, police depts with union contracts that grant more procedural protections to officers accused of misconduct are:
1) more likely to be reported for misconduct
2) less likely to uphold misconduct complaints
3) more likely to kill unarmed people https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=3246419

>So the contracts matter, and they need to be re-negotiated to increase levels of accountability and to reduce police violence. But what about the exceedingly low rate of officers being prosecuted? Well, we know more about this topic now than we did 5 years ago. For example...

>While only 1% of all killings by police result in officers being charged with a crime, this 1% isn’t evenly distributed. There are a handful of places that routinely charge officers while almost every other place fails to do so. And those places tend to have Black prosecutors.

>We still don’t know what tactics these prosecutors are using to secure indictments in these cases, but electing prosecutors (esp. Black prosecutors) who genuinely care about holding police accountable is important. This + video evidence are factors that can make the difference.

>So we now know:
>1) which depts have the worst police violence rates & which are reducing it
>2) a set of interventions/factors associated with reducing this violence and increasing accountability

>By continuing to study & scale up what works we can end police violence nationwide.

Anyway, my mom bought that mag (way over a decade ago), because she happened to be excite that her son was in a magazine. I think she thought it was going to be like Playboy... it was not.

My mom cut out all the offensive pages and left just us and the other articles so that my little brother could read it.

It was a multi-story museum that housed lots and lots of fine art. There was even a golden colored piano that was said to be Judy Garland's.  Bob's big thing was conversation. He'd host a great Italian dinner and talk about world affairs.

Fun Fact!: I actually did a little bit of research on the subject for a class project and studies show comprehensive sex ed (where they learn all about the reproductive cycle, sexual anatomy, contraception methods (including stressing abstinence being the only 100% effective method), and std education) teenage pregnancy rates and abortion rates were much lower than those of abstinence only sex-ed.

That is, if something will necessity become something else over time, unless something outside of its control befalls it, then, in many philosophic schools of thought, you would do well to think of the two states as having the same metaphysical status even if the material status at the time is different.

In the case of rape, then, potency has *already been acted upon* by an outside source, which would then supersede the potency of the bundle of cells.

Woman who lied about being raped on college campus gets jail,70,e0y7odz,"Looking at all the comments regarding innocent until proven guilty, and those who think it shouldn't be so, I felt I needed to put my two cents in.

I feel that yes there is a definitive need to treat the situation as though there is a crime that has occurred.  Equally, we must avoid any direct consequences against the accused, particularly in the case of rape, as rape accusations can get a man fired, and isolates socially from his peers, a terrible thing to happen if the man is found innocent.  Likewise, having their pleas ignores can be incredibly traumatic for the victim.

Think of it this way.  If someone came to you, and told them that their laptop had been stolen, you would of course believe them, and investigated further.  However, if someone came to you pointing the finger saying that ""this person"" stole my laptop, you would investigate the robbery with that person in mind, but would not necessarily blame that person or dole out consequence until definitive proof has been found.

This is how I believe rape accusations should be investigated and tried, to avoid devastation for both parties involved.",1

Woman who lied about being raped on college campus gets jail,286,e0ydkyy,"Had something similar. Started dating a girl freshman year of college. Over summer she convinced me we should move off campus and get a place. She didn't tell me her mother would be living with us and that neither of them would pay a single bill so I decided that I was going to move back to living on campus so I didn't have to work 40hours plus engineering classes. I said I would finish out the year at the place with them then move back home for the summer.

She got mad and broke up with me and I moved into the other room asking for a month to find a new place. She agreed, but her mother decided she no longer wanted me there and called the police on me. I got forcably removed from the place with just a backpack for the week.

 I had to set up an appointment with the police to get my stuff back and was not able to look through the items to make sure they were all there while on site. Later I had found she had taken a Nintendo Wii. I called the police, and they told me it wasn't there problem and that I would need a representative to call to arrange for them to give it back or that I could take them too small claims to get it returned.

 I had one of my parents call her mother to try and resolve this peacefully which did not go over well. Shortly after their conversation I see she blasted all over Facebook that I had supposedly raped her and that she was going to get me thrown in jail.

She got the school to start an investigation. I had to have several meetings with a detective who said that I would be able to have someone present during every meeting so I had my father with me every meeting. Multiple times the investigator berated me and my father when we provided multiple forms of evidence that I wasn't even in town during the supposed attack calling me a liar and telling me to shut up.

After I was cleared and proven not guilty I was told that if I sought recompense through any means  that I would be expelled from school and arrested for it.

Even being found innocent still can negatively affect someone's life as you will still be seen as the person who was caught up in the allegations.

I am glad they are trying to get more women toncomen forward about sexual harassment and attacks, but I feel that those who lie and make claims out of revenge, anger, or even deeper deceptions in your case should honestly be punished as it makes it difficult for the real cases to be taken seriously.

Tldr: got accused of rape after wishing to move back on campus and wanting my Nintendo Wii back.

I don't immediately believe the accused over the accuser, I just won't demonize the accused until evidence shows the claim to be substantiated.

Not that I don't feel every claim should be properly investigated, actual rapists should most definitely face the consequences for their actions, but I want proof before I will take the accusers side.

It is so easy to ruin someone's life by making horrible accusations against them on social media. I understand the impulse for those who have legitimately been victimized and are angry, but it is just far too easy to hurt innocent people without any repercussions or recourse. We need to change laws in a way that protects both victims and the accused- I think call out posts should be treated similar to revenge porn, for starters. Make it so the accused is able to have those posts removed immediately, back that up with legal sanctions if needed.

Woman who lied about being raped on college campus gets jail,194,e0y6x7m,"*Hearing* the case is kind of the key here, and the problem women face. Yes, innocent until proven guilty is sound and we as a society should uphold that. However, it is the duty of the police to investigate any claim that a crime was committed. Should you automatically side with the accuser? No, but you *should* be willing to listen to their story and take them seriously. Healthy skepticism doesn't give you permission to dismiss what an accuser has to say outright. 

No [sane, reasonable] woman is asking for everyone to always believe every woman because no woman ever lies. They're just asking for rape to be treated like every other crime: take them seriously enough to discover the truth.

Woman who lied about being raped on college campus gets jail,76,e0y6mmy,"This bothers me so much. Not even because false accusations can ruin lives, though that also bothers me greatly, but because it tells me that these people put in charge of my safety don't actually give a shit about difficult problems. It tells me they only care about themselves and the way they or their organization is perceived. Exactly like when 'Girls' writer Murray Miller was accused of raping an actress in 2012 and Lena Dunham, 'Girls' actress and extremely vocal supporter of victims of rape, said the actress was lying because she knew the accused to well. Lena makes this huge deal about wanting victims to feel safe enough to make accusations, but as soon as it's someone close to her professionally she has no problem calling victims liars. Lena, like that SAPE group, have no room in their ideology for something like false rape accusations. Eventually theyre forced to face that truth and they not only come off as hypocrites, but as people you absolutely cannot trust. That's fine if you're some second rate actress like Dunham, but it's incredibly unfortunate when you're in charge of educating students about sexual assault.",1

Firstly, he asks her what happened and she responds, maybe not the most articulately, but she states in her own view what happened. That's almost always a starting point for gathering evidence. That's why there's the common phrase ""describe what happened   in your own words"". You ask that, they respond, then you immediately move on to ask further clarifying questions to get more detail from the incident. Instead of doing this after the plaintiff told her side of the story, he immediately criticized her telling of the story and insisted that she hadn't informed him of what had happened. It was very unprofessional for him to say that after she had just given him a brief description of what happened. She repeated herself three times before he moved on to asking further questions, which would obviously make her feel as though she was not being listened to or believed. 

Then instead of asking her what actions she took to defend herself, he asks her ""Do you know how to stop somebody from having intercourse with you?"". This is probably the worse thing he says, worse than ""did she shut her legs"" because this is an extremely unclear and unprofessional question to ask in the courtroom as it has no obvious answer. It's a leading question and seems intended purely to trip the plaintiff up. A person, for instance could have knowledge of actions that might prevent them from being raped, but not have taken any of those actions in the moment. And also, does any one really know how to stop somebody from raping them? No one really knows a sureproof method of stopping themselves from getting raped that will work in every scenario. As such it has little bearing on the case whether the defendant ""knows"" how to stop a rape. A more appropriate question to ask would be ""Did you take any actions in an effort to prevent the defendant from having intercourse with you?"", and then allow the plaintiff to answer that question. Instead he just goes on asking her to list things she knows how to do to stop rape. This seems to be an effort to undermine her story by making her state everything she knows she should do, and then later being able to use that against her, for instance saying ""You mentioned that you knew that so and so was an option to prevent rape, how come you didn't do that to prevent him from raping you?""

Then after he continuously asks ""What else"" are options to prevent her from being raped, he starts adding options --- block your body parts, close your legs, call the police. The ""did you do any of those things?"" definitely comes off as disparaging, especially when as soon as she tries to answer, he interrupts her, which is again very unprofessional for a judge to cut off a witness. Listing three questions in a row, then not bothering to fully listen to the answer, smh. Also the courts don't usually use ""did you do any of the above"" questions. They want a specific answer to each detail of the question, so asking a question like ""Did you steal your brother's pen? Did you steal your brother's house?"" at the same time displays a desire to slant the answer. Either way the judge asking the witness if she closed her legs as an option to stop the rape also seems highly unprofessional as if closing her legs was an option she should have used to stop the rape. The ""Did you do any of these things"" implies that she did nothing or at least not enough to prevent herself from being raped.

From looking at this transcript, it definitely feels like the judge was basically doing the prosecutors' job of trying to entrap the witness (not that the prosecutor should have asked those kind of questions either), rather than being an impartial gatherer of information.",1

>Plaintiff: Okay. So I made a joke, like, ""What time does your wife come home?"" And next thing I know he was like, you know, grabbing at my clothes, pulling, you know, pulling my pants down. So I was like, you know, I didn't wanna have sex with him and it happened. And I was like, ""You know what, that was against my will."" And he's like, ""Well, you liked it; didn't you?"" I was like, you know, that's what happened.

>Respondent: All right. So I asked three times, but you haven't told me what happened. . . . .

>Plaintiff: Okay. So when I said, you know, ""What time does your wife come home,"" he came up to me and he's like pulling, pulling my pants down, and we had sexual intercourse. It was against my will. I didn't wanna, want to have sex with him, but it happened.

>Respondent: Did you tell him to stop?

>Plaintiff: Yeah. Yeah, I did. I was like, ""Stop. Get off me,"" and he's like, ""Oh, come on, come on,"" and he just didn't stop.

>Respondent: Okay. 

I've been raped. I can tell you that one of the hardest things to do in that circumstance is to have to relive the event piece by piece while you describe it to other people. When I had to do it, I kept doing what this woman is doing, because I was trying to speed the conversation along and get it over with as quickly as possible. I can't say for sure that that's what she's doing here, but it was so surreally similar to my own experience (except for the way that the judge was leading her with specific scenarios) that it made me shudder and get goosebumps.",1

Congratulations! You are now an admin of r/monkeyspaw",1
Judge Who Advised Woman to 'Close Your Legs' to Avoid Sexual Assault Permanently Removed From the Bench,18,frxwj48,"""how she tried to stop it""

Let's explore this thought process a bit. How do people think other people stop rape? They presume that the victim cries out, yells, punches, runs away and calls the police. 

In reality, crying out, yelling and fighting back, in practice, may result in the victim being violently sexually assaulted as opposed to sexually assaulted. ""May"" is not qualified. Is it a 50% chance? 100% chance? 1% chance? That probability is instinctively assessed while they're being sexually assaulted - which is not a rational/logical time to start calculating probabilities. 

Also, both men and women are shy to report because of the social mental and legal repercussions. No rape victim wants to be asked, ""Well, did you close your legs? Were you wearing sexually suggestive clothing? Why didn't you punch him and run away?"" 

Victim blaming, 100%. 

People need to talk to victims of assault more to understand that it's not an input-output situation. Nobody is like, ""oh, this person seems to be trying to rape me, I should politely bail""; they are more like, ""....what... what... what... um. what... I need to go... let me go... please let me go... I don't want trouble... is this really happening? ... I'm going to go."" When you're faced with inexplicable behaviour (attempted rape), people do not react ""logically"" and even if they do, it doesn't always result in a favourable outcome.

Judge Who Advised Woman to 'Close Your Legs' to Avoid Sexual Assault Permanently Removed From the Bench,16,frxprnz,"I took the end statement about her saying there was a chair he was forcing her against to mean it was from behind, but even if it was from the front, trying to press your knees together doesn't just magically eject a dick. 

As for why it was an inappropriate question from the judge, imagine if someone stabbed you on the street and the judge asked you 'well if you didn't want to be stabbed why didn't you just tense your abs and deflect the knife?'

Rape victims are already under pretty heavy emotional distress when they have to relive their assault to describe it during a trial. Add to that the bloodboiling rage of someone asking you why you didn't just do something physically impossible, implying that the crime that happened to you was a personal failing on your end.",1
