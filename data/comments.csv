Supreme Court rules workers can't be fired for being gay or transgender,12,fuxdxho,"Counter argument: it’s nearly impossible to pass an amendment now, particularly given current political partisanship. Congress must first agree on and approve the text of a proposed amendment by a 2/3 majority in both houses (or we can call a constitutional convention, which is even more unlikely); the amendment is then sent to the states and must be approved (ratified) 3/4 of the states, either by he state legislatures, or in state ratifying conventions. As you can see, achieving ratification would require a very high degree of concurrence throughout the United States, not only among the population, but also among elected officials (who often have more extreme views or cater to corporate/special interests).

In the last 50 years, 3 Constitutional Amendments have been proposed: (1) lowering the voting age to 18; (2) the Equal Rights Amendment; and (3) the DC Voting Rights Amendment, which would have given DC congressional representation. Only the first of these has been ratified and is an accepted part of the Constitution - the age change was prompted by the Vietnam war, and the general feeling that if young men could go fight and die for their country, they should be able to vote. The ERA (equal rights for women) was recently ratified by Virginia, thus becoming the requisite 38th state to ratify. However, the original bill putting the amendment up for ratification had an expiration date and the final ratifications were after the expiration. In addition, several states have voted to “revoke” their ratification, though it is unclear whether the revocation is legally binding in such a case. In any case, the status of the ERA is currently legally challenged and seems unlikely to be adopted any time soon.

You could argue that amendments should only be made when the population is in agreement on the matter, and indeed that seems to have been the framers’ intent. But current politics often favor interests of small groups over the views of the majority. For instance, polls show that most Americans favor common sense gun reforms such as requiring background checks and banning bump stocks. Yet we never manage to get even basic reform laws passed in Congress… because lawmakers back away when the NRA and gun manufacturers start complaining. So unless we find an issue that requires a constitutional amend,ent that is of such obvious clarity that no one disagrees (and seriously, have you looked around lately? people disagree on the craziest, most stupid shit), we almost certainly won’t see any new amendments in our lifetimes.",1

 cases of petition fraud like this are included in ""voter fraud"" numbers (edit: apparently to inflate them.)

Even with this addition, total vote fraud cases for 2018 totalled 1290, out of around 100,000,000. 

Of all things the [heritage foundation compiles these](https://www.heritage.org/voterfraud) and lists the charges by each state, look at them, most are offenses of this nature. It's ironic that thier own list contradicts thier claim of ""swelling numbers"" 

Another interesting tidbit:

many of the individual actual voter fraud cases are committed by Republicans who are driven by the exaggeration of fraud to ""counter"" what they Percieve as inevitable despite overwhelming contrary evidence.

It appears that fear mongering about voter fraud is more of a cause of it then the actual fraud itself.

Edit 2: if you review the list, you'll notice that not only are a vast majority not actual vote fraud, but didn't even occur on 2018 as the heading claims, from what I've reviewed there are cases as far back as 2002 on this list.

>There are other factors researchers have identified as impacting police violence rates. More racial segregation predicts more police violence (https://bu.edu/sph/2018/02/05/police-shootings-reflect-structural-racism/). **So does receiving military weapons from the feds** (https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/full/10.1177/1065912918784209
).

>Despite the US govt’s unwillingness to track police violence, we now have comprehensive data on killings by police via WaPo, http://mappingpoliceviolence.org & http://fatalencounters.org. While we don’t have enough data on non-fatal violence, we can learn a lot from the data we *do* have...

>When we break down the data by city, there are massive differences in police violence rates per population. St Louis, OKC and Orlando consistently have the highest rates of police violence. Killings are 3x less frequent in SF or Philly, 4x less in Detroit. http://mappingpoliceviolence.org/cities

>Who’s impacted by this violence? Black and brown people. This chart shows the race of unarmed people killed by police in major cities from 2013-19. Almost everyone was Black or Latinx. Black people are 3x more likely than whites to be killed by police & more likely to be unarmed.

>Among places that reduced police shootings, SF, Philly, Chicago, Denver, San Jose, LA, Phoenix and Baltimore made their use of force policies more restrictive during this period. Many had DOJ investigations. & many reformed enforcement of drugs/low level crime, reducing arrests.

>This is consistent with previous research finding departments with more restrictive use of force policies (http://useofforceproject.org) and DOJ interventions predict reduced police violence. Despite this, the Trump admin has stopped these DOJ investigations. https://vice.com/en_us/article/kznagw/jeff-sessions-is-walking-away-from-the-best-way-to-reduce-police-shootings

>Importantly, cities that reduced police shootings did so regardless of levels of crime. Crime rates (including violent crime rates) actually went up slightly in major cities during this period - but police shootings declined consistently with a 41% reduction during this time.

>On the other hand, having more Black officers is NOT associated with reducing police violence in most studies (some studies suggest more women on the force can help tho). Implicit bias training also hasn’t been shown to make a real difference. But a factor that DOES matter is...

>THE ACCOUNTABILITY SYSTEM. Just as some depts have higher violence rates, some officers have higher violence rates too. In Columbus, 6% of officers commit 50% of all use of force. When the system fails to hold them accountable it causes MAJOR problems...

>See now we can track how police misconduct spreads. And officers in close proximity to officers who have records of misconduct end up being 4x more likely to use force & 5x more likely to shoot someone. We can *contact trace* police violence like a virus. https://theintercept.com/2018/08/16/chicago-police-misconduct-social-network/

>Accountability systems work if they intervene & remove officers BEFORE misconduct spreads/escalates. But only 7% of excessive force complaints are upheld/result in discipline and 1% of killings result in prosecution. So these officers remain on the force. https://stories.usatodaynetwork.com/data_stories/police-use-of-force-data-a-huge-mess-across-the-u-s/

>Here too, data helps us understand how to increase accountability and decrease police violence. Misconduct complaints are more likely to be upheld when depts have body cams (video=key) but much less likely to be upheld in depts with police union contracts. https://gothamgazette.com/city/9167-initial-report-shows-benefits-and-challenges-of-nypd-body-camera-program-for-watchdog-agency

>This is because police union contracts are where the accountability system is set. Most contracts purge misconduct records, restrict misconduct investigations and help officers overturn discipline and get reinstated after being fired for misconduct. http://checkthepolice.org

>In fact, police depts with union contracts that grant more procedural protections to officers accused of misconduct are:
1) more likely to be reported for misconduct
2) less likely to uphold misconduct complaints
3) more likely to kill unarmed people https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=3246419

>So the contracts matter, and they need to be re-negotiated to increase levels of accountability and to reduce police violence. But what about the exceedingly low rate of officers being prosecuted? Well, we know more about this topic now than we did 5 years ago. For example...

>While only 1% of all killings by police result in officers being charged with a crime, this 1% isn’t evenly distributed. There are a handful of places that routinely charge officers while almost every other place fails to do so. And those places tend to have Black prosecutors.

>We still don’t know what tactics these prosecutors are using to secure indictments in these cases, but electing prosecutors (esp. Black prosecutors) who genuinely care about holding police accountable is important. This + video evidence are factors that can make the difference.

>So we now know:
>1) which depts have the worst police violence rates & which are reducing it
>2) a set of interventions/factors associated with reducing this violence and increasing accountability

>By continuing to study & scale up what works we can end police violence nationwide.

Death would be too extreme for you, but I hope that one day you can experience the unreasoned prejudice you exercise in the police force first hand on the receiving end. Then, perhaps, once you find through your confusion that there IS no reason you're being mistreated, perhaps you can finally understand why you are currently such a piece of shit.

I genuinely hope that whatever family was born from your tainted loins can cast aside your influence and grow up to be more useful and human than you are, rather then the growing cancer more copies of you would metaphorically represent.

Fuck you, officer. There are no more words I can even type to fully explain my hatred. Thinking about you and your stupid actions and beliefs has left me angry and embittered even while I was having a good day. So thank you, officer, for being so utterly repugnant in your every aspect to make people's day worse not by interacting with them, but simply by your reputation. Congratulations, you've managed to continue the American politics tradition of turning a step forward into a backflip into a noose. Fuck you.

He even put our band in a 6 page article in his magazine because of his love for our friend (we felt we were good, but not that good :)  
  
Anyway, my mom bought that mag (way over a decade ago), because she happened to be excite that her son was in a magazine. I think she thought it was going to be like Playboy... it was not. It was their raunchiest (for their standards) issue to date because the internet was making soft porn mags like Penthouse look like Readers Digest. And this one, although they had soft lenses and the artistic style you'd find in a Penthouse, was near Hustler raunchy. My mom cut out all the offensive pages and left just us and the other articles so that my little brother could read it.  
  
Anyway, I came to say that it seemed to me like the tameness of Playboy was the opposite of what was rumored to happen at the mansion. And - at least in the 2000's, well past the prime of the mag, the harder core of Penthouse was in contrast to the total tame residence that was Guccione's residence in NYC. It was a multi-story museum that housed lots and lots of fine art. There was even a golden colored piano that was said to be Judy Garland's.  Bob's big thing was conversation. He'd host a great Italian dinner and talk about world affairs.

Fun Fact!: I actually did a little bit of research on the subject for a class project and studies show comprehensive sex ed (where they learn all about the reproductive cycle, sexual anatomy, contraception methods (including stressing abstinence being the only 100% effective method), and std education) teenage pregnancy rates and abortion rates were much lower than those of abstinence only sex-ed.

Instead of interviewing her as a victim, they interrogated her as a suspect. Under pressure, Marie eventually recanted — and was charged with false reporting, punishable by up to a year in jail.
