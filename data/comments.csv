Supreme Court rules workers can't be fired for being gay or transgender,14560,fuwjp7b,"This is [a historic decision](https://www.supremecourt.gov/opinions/19pdf/17-1618_hfci.pdf) which will protect hundreds of thousands of LGBT employees from discrimination. The opinion was 6-3, written by Justice Gorsuch and joined by Roberts, Kagan, Sotomayor, Ginsburg and Breyer. Kavanugh, Alito, and Thomas dissented.

As of today, the Supreme Court puts being gay or transgender in the same category as being black when it comes to employment discrimination. You cannot fire or discriminate against an employee for being black and you cannot fire or discriminate against an employee for being gay or trans.

Here are the opening two paragraphs. They explain everything you need to know:

>Sometimes small gestures can have unexpected consequences. Major initiatives practically guarantee them. In
our time, few pieces of federal legislation rank in significance with the Civil Rights Act of 1964. There, in Title VII,
Congress outlawed discrimination in the workplace on the
basis of race, color, religion, sex, or national origin. Today,
we must decide whether an employer can fire someone
simply for being homosexual or transgender. The answer
is clear. An employer who fires an individual for being homosexual or transgender fires that person for traits or actions it would not have questioned in members of a different
sex. Sex plays a necessary and undisguisable role in the
decision, exactly what Title VII forbids.

>Those who adopted the Civil Rights Act might not have
anticipated their work would lead to this particular result.
Likely, they weren’t thinking about many of the Act’s consequences that have become apparent over the years, including its prohibition against discrimination on the basis
of motherhood or its ban on the sexual harassment of male
employees. But the limits of the drafters’ imagination supply no reason to ignore the law’s demands. When the express terms of a statute give us one answer and extratextual considerations suggest another, it’s no contest. Only
the written word is the law, and all persons are entitled to
its benefit.",0

Supreme Court rules workers can't be fired for being gay or transgender,941,fuwjpr7,Another historic day for a historic piece of legislation. The Civil Rights Act of 1964 has probably had the most positive impact of any Act of Congress in this country's history.,0
Supreme Court rules workers can't be fired for being gay or transgender,153,fuwy3kg,"Gorsuch's example below really cuts to the heart of the Court's reasoning. Title VII prohibits firing someone on the basis of ""sex"" (but not sexual orientation).  However, Gorsuch's reasoning is that an employer who discriminates on the basis of sexual orientation necessarily discriminates on the basis of sex:

> Imagine an employer who has a policy of firing any employee known to be homosexual. The employer hosts an office holiday party and invites employees to bring their spouses. A model employee arrives and introduces a manager to Susan, the employee’s wife. Will that employee be fired? If the policy works as the employer intends, the answer depends entirely on whether the model employee is a man or a woman. **To be sure, that employer’s ultimate goal might be to discriminate on the basis of sexual orientation. But to achieve that purpose the employer must, along the way, intentionally treat an employee worse based in part on that individual’s sex.**

The Court sidestepped the argument over what ""sex"" means:
> Appealing to roughly contemporaneous dictionaries, the employers say that, as used here, the term “sex” in 1964 referred to “status as either male or female [as] determined by reproductive biology.” The employees counter by submitting that, even in 1964, the term bore a broader scope, capturing more than anatomy and reaching at least some norms concerning gender identity and sexual orientation. **But because nothing in our approach to these cases turns on the outcome of the parties’ debate, and because the employees concede the point for argument’s sake, we proceed on the assumption that “sex” signified what the employers suggest, referring only to biological distinctions between male and female.**",0
Supreme Court rules workers can't be fired for being gay or transgender,1010,fuwl5qv,"> **Aimee Stephens**, a transgender funeral director who was fired after announcing her intention to present as a woman. 

This one was, in my opinion, the most clear cut example of how someone was fired for not conforming to traditional gender roles in society was an example of sex discrimination. 

She was identifying as a woman, and I believe was going through or had gone through the transition, and because she wouldn't wear a men's suit, she was fired. 

I was afraid with the composition of the Court, they wouldn't see it that way, and curtail LGBTQ rights in the workplace but this is a HUGE ruling.",0

Note though that there are many LGBT rights still on the line and that the 2020 election matters in terms of LGBT rights. After having falsely claimed that he'd be better for LGBT rights during the 2016 election campaign, [Trump has rolled back a large number of LGBT protections](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Presidency_of_Donald_Trump#LGBT_rights):

>The administration rolled back numerous LGBT protections, in particular those implemented during the Obama administration, covering issues such as health care, education, employment, housing, military, and criminal justice, as well as foster care and adoption.[536][537][538][539][540] The administration sought to rescind rules prohibiting adoption and foster care agencies funded by the government from discriminating against LGBT adoption and foster parents.[538] The DOJ reversed its position on whether the Civil Rights Act's workplace protections covered LGBT individuals, and the DOJ argued in state and federal courts for a constitutional right for businesses to discriminate on the basis of sexual orientation and gender identity.[538] The administration exempted government contractors from following federal workplace discrimination rules, as long as they could cite religious reasons for doing so.[538]

> The administration rescinded a directive that public schools treat students according to their gender identity.[538] The administration rescinded a federal policy that allowed transgender students to use bathrooms corresponding to their gender identity, and dropped a lawsuit against North Carolina's ""bathroom bill"".[541] The administration rescinded rules that prohibited discrimination against LGBT patients by health care providers.[538][542] Rules were rescinded to give transgender homeless people equal access to homeless shelters, and to house transgender prison inmates according to their gender identity ""when appropriate"".[538] HHS stopped collecting information on LGBT participants in its national survey of older adults,[543] and the Census Bureau removed ""sexual orientation"" and ""gender identity"" as proposed subjects for possible inclusion on the Decennial Census and/or American Community Survey.[543] The DOJ and the Labor Department cancelled quarterly conference calls with LGBT organizations.[543]

> Trump said he would not allow ""transgender individuals to serve in any capacity in the U.S. Military"", citing disruptions and medical costs.[538] In March 2018, President Trump signed a Presidential Memorandum to prohibit transgender persons, whether transitioned or not, with a history or diagnosis of gender dysphoria from military service, except for individuals who have had 36 consecutive months of stability ""in their biological sex prior to accession"" and currently serving transgender persons in military service. Studies of countries that had allowed transgender individuals to serve in the military found ""little or no impact on unit cohesion, operational effectiveness, or readiness"",[544] and studies showed that the medical costs for transgender service members would be ""minimal"".[545]

Just a few days ago, the Trump administration [rolled back a protection against transgender discrimination by health care providers.](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/06/13/health/trump-health-care-transgender-rights.html) And it goes with saying that this Supreme Court decision is a defeat for the Trump administration, which had argued that Title VII of the Civil Rights Act (that bars discrimination based on sex) did not extend to claims of gender identity and sexual orientation.

This is not solely a Trump issue, but a [Republican Party issue](https://twitter.com/bindersab/status/1272551518663847936):

No, it doesn't mean you'll win your lawsuit. No, it doesn't mean you'll be able to prove it if you're lacking any evidence. But the legal protection for the LGBTQ+ community is huge.

I mean the Court now says it's a Title VII that you can't discriminate against for being gay or trans. Healthcare should be bound by Title VII as well.

Now for my conspiracy theory....

I had been wondering why they released these new guidelines while the Supreme Court was considering this case. It didn't make any sense to release new guidelines when they might be overturned as soon as the Supreme Court releases their decision. Now that this has happened so quickly after the guidelines were released I REALLY think it was done on purpose.

If Trump's people got a heads up that this was the court's decision (those papers take time to write) then they could have scrambled and gotten their healthcare guidelines out FIRST as a sort of dogwhistle for his followers. The sort of thing they want to show that they're there to discriminate against the gays and trans and get it out there before the Supreme Court makes that guideline impossible to follow.",1

You should know that it is tradition for the justice who is *least* persuaded (closest to voting the other way) to write the opinion.

Think of it this way: If Kagan had written the opinion, then she might write some sweeping ruling about LGBT rights being human rights in any and all cases. Gorsuch might then be hesitant to agree to that ruling, possibly issuing a [concurring opinion](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Concurring_opinion) -- saying he agrees with Kagan's conclusion, but not her reasoning behind it -- or even changing his vote.

Since the court kept this to a very narrow definition of ""sex"" (biological sex) that means that if somebody who is biologically female can date men and dress as a woman and not be fired, then somebody who is biologically male needs to enjoy these same protections.

I'm not knowledgeable enough to answer much of this, but I can point you to [National Federation of Independent Business v. Sebelius](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Federation_of_Independent_Business_v._Sebelius#Chief_Justice_Roberts'_opinion), the decision that upheld much of the Affordable Care Act (aka The ACA or Obamacare).

It illustrates almost everything that I mentioned above. Roberts (the only Republican-appointed justice who ruled that the act ought to be upheld) wrote the majority opinion, because he clearly was on the fence...but it gets more complicated. 

His opinion had four parts, and only three of those were agreed upon by a majority of justices. One other was joined by a plurality...which is unusual.

Four justices (all of the others that were appointed by Republican presidents) agreed on a dissenting opinion.

Roberts wrote an additional opinion that was a dissent, which no one else supported.

Ginsburg wrote an opinion that was *both a concurrence and a dissent*, and Sotomayor joined her.

...and I think that all illustrates how close the decision was.

----------

I've never actually heard much ado about who gets chosen to write the dissent; probably because it doesn't matter as much. The majority opinion becomes literal law. The dissent is more of an intellectual curiosity.

 Now since the government has a right to discriminate on a reasonable level a Supreme Court Case or denial to hear an Appellate Court ruling in order to nullify it. Now it's affirmed the Government has a right to discriminate. It's the basis for a lot of things in how everything works. They discriminate on age regularly as the basis of minority laws, Medicare age requirements etc. So based on my understanding a Supreme Court ruling will be needed that cites this case as it's basis to affirm what Trump did is infact unconstitutional. Now since he rolled back these protections doesn't mean that insurance companies are going to. He just enabled them to, but they might not based on the ruling today as it opens them up to private lawsuits as it's discrimination based upon sex. 

Tldr: Court case needed. Trump makes it so insurance can do it. SCOTUS made it able that you can sue them if they do it.",0

Supreme Court rules workers can't be fired for being gay or transgender,181,fuxv4fl,"Gorsuch's decision is ""textualist"", in that it's based on a plain-English reading of the text of the law itself. Some dissenters do so on ""originalist"" grounds, which considers the text of the law and its understood meaning at the time it was passed. So, in this example, they are rejecting Gorsuch's argument on the grounds that the 88th Congress couldn't possibly have meant ""orientation"" when they explicitly said ""sex"" (especially given that sexual orientation discrimination was the widely accepted law of the land), and the fact that our cultural understanding of and use of the word ""sex"" might have changed shouldn't *automatically, retroactively* change a law drafted in 1964.

Both are ""right"", and straightforward in their way, but can each have unintended consequences. Consider a second example:

The 2nd Amendment guarantees the right of the people to ""keep and bear arms"". At the time, this would be widely understood to encompass the armaments commonly used in war at the time: flintlock muskets and handguns, swords, maybe cannons, etc. Should that limited, original meaning constrain modern interpretation? Or should it include arms that are employed today, like machine guns or drones?

Textualism lends itself to a ""left-wing"" interpretation in the first example, and a ""right-wing"" outcome in the second example. This is why it's important for people who view the world as being organized on a Left-to-Right spectrum need to be careful about kicking decisions like this to the courts - jurists have other spectrums, other philosophies, that apply to their work.

Additionally, what she said is objectively true",0
Supreme Court rules workers can't be fired for being gay or transgender,535,fuwtlya,"Here is the relevant passage from the dissent (with which I fully disagree):

>Contrary  to  the  Court’s  contention,  discrimination  because  of sexual  orientation  or gender  identity does not  in 
and of  itself entail discrimination because of sex.  We can 
see this because it is quite possible for an employer to discriminate on those grounds without taking the sex of an individual applicant or employee into account.  An employer
can have a policy that says: “We do not hire gays, lesbians,
or transgender  individuals.”  And an employer can  implement  this  policy  without  paying  any  attention  to  or  even 
knowing the biological sex of gay, lesbian, and transgender
applicants.

Edit: To explain why I disagree, for an employer to know whether an employee is homosexual or transgender, the employer **must** know (or assume) the employee's sex. Scenario: Employer Tom is interviewing Employee Jim. Employee Jim shares that he recently bought a home with his husband Terry. Tom decides not to employ Jim because Jim is gay. The only way for Tom to know Jim is gay is to know that Jim is **Male** and has a husband. If Tom did not know or consider that Jim was male (as contested in the dissent) then him having a husband does not disqualify him under the discriminatory policy. Thus the policy **is** using sex as a deciding factor. Similarly, Susan identifies as female and applies at Tom's business. He says, sorry, I have a no transgender policy and refuses to hire her. For him to identify her as transgender, Tom must know (or assume) her biological sex. Again, he does use sex in the hiring decision and is therefore against the plain text of title VII.

Edit 2: I've been getting a lot of replies saying essentially, ""Well, the employer could just put a checkbox on the application asking if the individual is homosexual or transgender and disqualify them that way without knowing their sex."" They could, but notice that in the dissent, the author writes, "". . . an employer can  **implement**  this  policy  without  paying  any  attention  to  or  even knowing the biological sex of gay, lesbian, and transgender
applicants."" (Emphasis mine) How would this policy be implemented (in other words, enforced) without knowledge of sex? If Susan (the transgender woman in my example) says that she is not transgender on the form, how is the employer to respond? He can't say, ""Yes you are, you are fired for being transgender,"" because to identify her as transgender would be to assume her biological sex and presented gender differ. The employer also cannot say, ""You lied on your application, you are fired,"" because to establish such a lie would also assume her biological sex and presented gender differ. The discriminatory policy would be unenforceable and therefore un-implementable.",0

Conservatism should make change more difficult and take longer because it is attempting to ensure said change falls within the rules of our country. 

Once that ideology is lost then you have two groups, progressives and fascists.  One attempts to centralize power in order to ensure fairness and the greater good for the country is upheld.  The other group uses that centralized power to gain further power in order to maintain it in perpetuity.  

This all being said there is a reason I call myself a conservative and not a republican.  The republican party lost all semblance of conservatism outside of some basic pandering and moved to straight up populism which is an ideology I fear more than any other as it has never ended well.",0

Supreme Court rules workers can't be fired for being gay or transgender,13,fuxdxho,"Counter argument: it’s nearly impossible to pass an amendment now, particularly given current political partisanship. Congress must first agree on and approve the text of a proposed amendment by a 2/3 majority in both houses (or we can call a constitutional convention, which is even more unlikely); the amendment is then sent to the states and must be approved (ratified) 3/4 of the states, either by he state legislatures, or in state ratifying conventions. As you can see, achieving ratification would require a very high degree of concurrence throughout the United States, not only among the population, but also among elected officials (who often have more extreme views or cater to corporate/special interests).

In the last 50 years, 3 Constitutional Amendments have been proposed: (1) lowering the voting age to 18; (2) the Equal Rights Amendment; and (3) the DC Voting Rights Amendment, which would have given DC congressional representation. Only the first of these has been ratified and is an accepted part of the Constitution - the age change was prompted by the Vietnam war, and the general feeling that if young men could go fight and die for their country, they should be able to vote. The ERA (equal rights for women) was recently ratified by Virginia, thus becoming the requisite 38th state to ratify. However, the original bill putting the amendment up for ratification had an expiration date and the final ratifications were after the expiration. In addition, several states have voted to “revoke” their ratification, though it is unclear whether the revocation is legally binding in such a case. In any case, the status of the ERA is currently legally challenged and seems unlikely to be adopted any time soon.

You could argue that amendments should only be made when the population is in agreement on the matter, and indeed that seems to have been the framers’ intent. But current politics often favor interests of small groups over the views of the majority. For instance, polls show that most Americans favor common sense gun reforms such as requiring background checks and banning bump stocks.

Arizona Senator John McCain has passed away at the age of 81,3974,e4u5tql,And what a life he lived.,0
Arizona Senator John McCain has passed away at the age of 81,1454,e4u82br,"""But there's something underneath politics in the way you have to hear McCain, something riveting and unSpinnable and true. It has to do with McCain’s military background and Vietnam combat and the five-plus years he spent in a North Vietnamese prison, mostly in solitary, in a box, getting tortured and starved. And the unbelievable honor and balls he showed there. 

It's very easy to gloss over the POW thing, partly because we've all heard so much about it and partly because it’s so off-the – charts dramatic, like something in a movie instead of a man's life. But it’s worth considering for a minute, because it’s what makes McCain's ""causes greater than self-interest"" line easier to hear.

You probably already know what happened. 

In October of '67 McCain was himself still a Young Voter and ﬂying his 23rd Vietnam combat mission and his A-4 Skyhawk plane got shot down over Hanoi and he had to eject, which basically means setting off an explosive charge that blows your seat out of the plane, which ejection broke both McCain's arms and one leg and gave him a concussion and he started falling out of the skies right over Hanoi. 

Try to imagine for a second how much this would hurt and how scared you'd be, three limbs broken and falling toward the enemy capital you just tried to bomb. His chute opened late and he landed hard in a little lake in a park right in the middle of downtown Hanoi, 

Imagine treading water with broken arms and trying to pull the life vest's toggle with your teeth as a crowd of Vietnamese men swim out toward you (there's film of this, somebody had a home – movie camera, and the N.V. government released it, though it's grainy and McCain's face is hard to see). The crowd pulled him out and then just about killed him. 

U.S. bomber pilots were especially hated, for obvious reasons. McCain got bayoneted in the groin; a soldier broke his shoulder apart with a riﬂe butt. Plus by this time his right knee was bent 90-degrees to the side with the bone sticking out. Try to imagine this. 

He finally got tossed on a jeep and taken five blocks to the infamous Hoa Lo prison – a.k.a. the ""Hanoi Hilton,"" of much movie fame – where they made him beg a week for a doctor and finally set a couple of the fractures without anesthetic and let two other fractures and the groin wound (imagine: groin wound) stay like they were. Then they threw him in a cell. Try for a moment to feel this. All the media profiles talk about how McCain still can't lift his arms over his head to comb his hair, which is true. 

But try to imagine it at the time, yourself in his place, because it's important. Think about how diametrically opposed to your own self-interest getting knifed in the balls and having fractures set without painkiller would be, and then about getting thrown in a cell to just lie there and hurt, which is what happened. 

He was delirious with pain for weeks, and his weight dropped to 100 pounds, and the other POWs were sure he would die; and then after a few months like that after his bones mostly knitted and he could sort of stand up they brought him in to the prison commandant's office and offered to let him go. This is true. They said he could just leave. They had found out that McCain's father was one of the top-ranking naval officers in the U.S. Armed Forces (which is true – both his father and grandfather were admirals), and the North Vietnamese wanted the PR coup of mercifully releasing his son, the baby-killer. 

McCain, 100 pounds and barely able to stand, refused, The U.S. military's Code of Conduct for Prisoners of War apparently said that POWs had to be released in the order they were captured, and there were others who'd been in Hoa Lo a long time, and McCain refused to violate the Code. 

The commandant, not pleased, right there in the office had guards break his ribs, rebreak his arm, knock his teeth out. McCain still refused to leave without the other POWs. And so then he spent four more years in Hoa Lo like this, much of the time in solitary, in the dark, in a closet-sized box called a ""punishment cell."" 

Maybe you've heard all this before; it's been in umpteen different media profiles of McCain. But try to imagine that moment between getting offered early release and turning it down. Try to imagine it was you. 

Imagine how loudly your most basic, primal self-interest would have cried out to you in that moment, and all the ways you could rationalize accepting the offer. Can you hear it? It so, would you have refused to go? You simply can't know for sure. None of us can. It's hard even to imagine the pain and fear in that moment, much less know how you'd react. 

But, see, we do know how this man reacted. That he chose to spend four more years there, in a dark box, alone, tapping code on the walls to the others, rather than violate a Code. Maybe he was nuts. But the point is that with McCain it feels like we know, for a proven fact, that he’s capable of devotion to something other, more, than his own self-interest. So that when he says the line in speeches in early February you can feel like maybe it isn't just more candidate bullshit, that with this guy it's maybe the truth.

Or maybe both the truth and bullshit: the guy does – did – want your vote, after all.

But that moment in the Hoa Lo office in '68 – right before he refused, with all his basic normal human self-interest howling at him – that moment is hard to blow off.""

Edit:

I was asked to add this:


TLDR:

 • John Sidney McCain III, who was born August 29, 1936 in the Panama Canal Zone, has died after battling an aggressive form of brain cancer

 • McCain hailed from a decorated military family; both his father and grandfather were four-star admirals in the United States Navy

 • He followed their example and attended the United States Naval Academy before training as a naval pilot and volunteering for Vietnam combat missions

 • McCain was shot down in 1967 and spent more than five years as a prisoner of war, refusing release until all POWs captured before him had been freed

 • He was released in 1973 following the Paris Peace Accords, which ended direct US military involvement in Vietnam, and returned home with extensive injuries

 • He retired from the Navy in 1981 - the same year he married his second wife, Cindy - and ran for Congress the following year

 • McCain served in Congress for more than 30 years and made two unsuccessful bids for the US presidency as a Republican candidate

 • McCain is survived by his wife, Cindy, seven children and several grandchildren

 • He told graduates of the US Naval Academy in October of his 'sense of honor'  and added:  'May your lives be as lucky as mine'

>John McCain is the person I strive to be as an adult.

>The man spent 5 ½ years as a POW in Vietnam, enduring daily torture. Some accounts from fellow prisoners even went so far as to say that, if other prisoners were targeted for interrogation and torture, he would deliberately act aggressively, creating outbursts so that the attention would be drawn to him, and he would be beaten instead. His limbs and ribs were broken and re-broken constantly, and he was never able to completely recover. He endured daily rope beatings for two hours, all the while suffering from dysentery. And yet still, he made sure that the men he was with were taken care of. When his father, John McCain Jr. was named commander of all US forces in Europe, the North Vietnamese attempted to make a deal with him in order to release his son. John McCain III refused, saying that he would not leave the NVA prison unless every single soldier that was there with him was release as well. And then the beatings continued. To this day, he is incapable of raising his arms above his head due to the torture he endured.

>At this point he could have left the military and still been a hell of a war hero. But he didn’t do that. He endured grueling physical therapy all in the hopes of staying in the military, so he could ensure that other members were taken care of. He stayed in the military for 22 years.

>He could have retired to a nice quiet life again at this point, but he didn’t. He still had a desire to change the world. McCain ran for the Senate in 1982, at one point delivering the most devastating political response ever to someone who accused him of district shopping:

>“Listen, pal. I spent 22 years in the Navy. My father was in the Navy. My grandfather was in the Navy. We in the military service tend to move a lot. We have to live in all parts of the country, all parts of the world. I wish I could have had the luxury, like you, of growing up and living and spending my entire life in a nice place like the First District of Arizona, but I was doing other things. As a matter of fact, when I think about it now, the place I lived longest in my life was Hanoi.”

>And he stayed in, still championing various bills which he believed would better the world. Now, history has shown us that some of these ideas obviously weren’t the best in retrospect, but he still wanted to leave the world in a better state than he found it.

>In 2008, he ran against Barack Obama for President. I need to note that at this time, he vehemently opposed any notion that he would run ads, or stand on a platform that mudslings. His mentality was that he would run his campaign on a foundation of voters choosing which ideals they wanted represented in office. No cheap shots or insults would be allowed in his campaign. There’s a video on YouTube where he invited an elderly woman on stage who accused Barack Obama of being Arabic. His response? “ “No ma'am. He’s a decent family man, citizen, that I just happen to have disagreements with on fundamental issues.”

>And in 2010, while the Republican party was staunchly entrenched against the President, filibustering as much as they could against his policies, one of which was the repeal of “Don’t ask, Don’t tell,” it was John McCain who said that, consequences be damned, I’m not going to sit here and try to win a political trench war against everything. This guy has some good ideas, and I’m not going to stop everything he says on principle, I’m going to have some discourse.

>I would also be remiss if I did not mention the fact that he spent his whole life believing that homosexuality is immoral. He was even against the repeal of “Don’t Ask, Don’t Tell” But in 2013, he totally reversed his opinion of it. Think about that for a moment. at 76 years old, this man said “you know what? I was wrong my whole life about something.” That takes mental fortitude that I’ve never personally seen in any individual. Even now, he is a champion of LGBT rights in both the military and America as a whole.
To this day, John McCain is the poster child of bipartisanship in politics. He is a man who lives by the phrase “We might disagree on some things, but we can agree on some things in order to make this world a better place.”
John Sidney McCain III is the the person I strive to be as a soldier, an American, and a human. If I grow to be but a fraction of the person he is, I will consider my life an accomplished one indeed.

>Edit: Holy wow this blew up. Thank you all for the love and gold that's come my way! I want to use this temporary platform to talk about something just as important to me as John McCain is: you. Please don't just read this and forget it. Follow the legacy that he has led his whole life. Go out and be selfless. Be kind. Call your mom. Say hi to your neighbors. Offer to carry groceries for the lady struggling to push a buggy at the grocery store. Go volunteer at the local animal or homeless shelter.

“He is a decent person and a person that you do not have to be scared of as Pf resident,” McCain said. “If I didn’t think I’d be one heck of a better President I wouldn’t be running, and that’s the point. I admire Sen. Obama and his accomplishments, I will respect him. I want everyone to be respectful, and let’s make sure we are. Because that’s the way politics should be conducted in America.”

Arizona Senator John McCain has passed away at the age of 81,138,e4ulafc,"People really need to think about the POW part, and 5 years. I have spent 7 months in jail, modern jail, where the biggest true complaint is the boredom. He did 5 years in prison, where torture wasn't just commonplace, but expected of the guards. Back in the day as well. No calls home, I can't imagine the ""food"" and how scarce it was, or the bed/room/accommodations respective conditions were. 

Now to really set this the fuck off... Imagine the not knowing. If you don't see light at the end of the tunnel you start to flip the fuck out. A jail here has a start and end. There was no end date to that, and 5 years of that hell, never knowing if you'll die there, or even get out and see your family again would honestly destroy most minds. That is so very fucking much to mentally handle. So you hope every goddamn day when you wake up, that this will be the one day you finally get the hell out. Except repeat that at least 1825 times, or mornings. Keep that blind level of hope day in, day out, when you know damn well death maybe the reason you meet your last day in there, under complete shit conditions that are MEANT to break you well over one thousand eight hundred and twenty five times. Most people will never, thankfully, go through a fucking hell like that, so they cannot understand what it's like emotionally, but I am asking you to think about it just from the logic side of things and the see the sheer scope of things JUST over a 5 year (feels like 500) period of time, just to come back and be a senator. A senator that's not super rich or lavish. He stuck to his beliefs and there were reasons for those beliefs. We do not all agree, never will, that is part of being different. Thing was he stuck to his beliefs regardless of what his party's wishes were. He was not a follower in that sense at all. 

I voted for him when he ran, because when I was in the Marines around 2000 he was a senator that really stuck out as someone who would give good troop support. And knowing what the bad side of war could be like, he didn't seem like the type to throw us around anywhere there was a pissing match, complete with our own weapons to fight against. It wasn't that I didn't like Obama, it was that he kept himself aligned with the ""make friends not enemies, but if you want to be an enemy he would not tolerate you attacking us, and will make sure the military coming at you is not just well trained, but well provisioned as well"" mantra.

He didn't put us in Iraq after 9/11 but he made sure, because we were already there, that he would support funding the military with what they would need. I figured he, like Obama, would finalize this Iraq thing, and get us home as well. I had said back then if he ran for president he had my vote. So I stuck to what I said and voted for him. Even though it'll piss some off by me saying this, it's the only time I have ever voted in my life. I am 39.

It may be an antibody that teaches the immune system to kill the tumors itself.  Or it may be an enzyme that has yet to be discovered.  

Scientific research moves at a glacial pace.  But it is figuratively moving mountains.  Someday we will explain to our grandchildren how scary cancer used to be.  Chemotherapy will be as foreign to them as the image of children in the iron lung is to us.

And what's most amazing is that we will accomplish this together as a massive group effort.

Arizona Senator John McCain has passed away at the age of 81,183,e4uelcx,"Since you've volunteered the info of your profession, here's a question (though someone working hospice may be better suited to answer this): 

If there's no chance of improvement, and no quality of life to be eked out in remaining days, to the point that the patient is essentially laying there waiting to die - well, I've heard the term 'snowballing', where pain meds just start being given without concern for possible side effect of death. How does one... ask for that? *Can* you ask for that?


I watched my great grandfather drag on for half a year in pain (at the age of 103) and by the last few days, he was crying because he wanted to die so much, and the pain was so bad. He was pretty much mostly blind and deaf, with most of his memory gone at the end. He was only alive because there was no legal way for him to end things.

Edit: based on the responses, at the very very end (as in last week of his life) it seems like he was getting 'comfort care'. He wasn't conscious much because of the medication, but it was preferable to him being awake and in pain from the feeling of his body lying in a heavily padded bed. ",1

Her asshole husband who is now in custody charged with third degree murder is probably an asshole to her, too. Assholes who beat and murder people do horrible things to their own family, too. The wives are often the first victims of abuse by men who would later go on to kill someone.

Of course, statistical truth matters. But the main point here is simply that she could also be a victim of abuse by her asshole soon to be ex husband. This is of course one of many scenarios; we just don’t know anything about her family life with him. 

All we know are two truths: he clearly has a well documented history of abuse and he was caught on video murdering George Floyd. Prosecute him. Prosecute the other officers standing around. Hell, investigate and prosecute all of MPD for their oppressive history of policing and racial profiling. But leave her out of this. She has nothing to do with this.

* he had been investigated for brutality incidents before
* he had 18 complaints on his file (although we don't know how many may have been about excessive force because the police department refuses to disclose that)
* he had been involved in at least one other fatal incident, and the veracity of police reports on that prior incident are now worthless given he and 3 other members of the MPD all blatantly lied about *this* incident when there were witnesses and cameras filming
* the owner of the club he worked part-time at said that he was known for escalating situations and using aggressive 'overkill' measures where they were not necessary, especially against minorities

My friend was literally in this exact situation. I met her when she was 38, she told me one day at work that she was down because her husband had threatened to hit her. As someone with a past of abuse, I gently pushed for details to try and see how bad it was and if I could help her. Turns out the prick had been abusing her since she was 16 (legal age for sex and choice to leave the home here). He was 20 and convinced her that they were ment to be together and to move out so they could get married and start a life...

She told me that it only took him 2 weeks before he hit her for the first time. Over the course of 22 years she had a medical history sheet like you wouldnt believe, had 3 kids that she kept shielded from his wrath and sickeningly, multiple miscarriages due to the abuse.

He was a cop though and well liked in the smallish community, she told me she tried to run several times before her kids were born and he always found her, or other cops found her and brought her back to him. Then once her kids were born he would tell her that if she left he would find them, tie them together in the house and burn the place down. Really horrific shit.

Convinced her to get out, wrote my phone number down on a peice of paper, since he would read her phone and delete new numbers, and made her put it in the folds of her purse fabric. After a few weeks I ended up leaving that job (just a temp) and about 3 months later she finally messaged me to tell me that she and her kids had gotten free. Turns out since she couldnt go to the cops about it she had to go through an illegal womans refuge and relocation, as taking children away from thier father without proper reason can get them taken back.

So much pain and suffering on one of the kindest ladies I know, and she couldnt go to the people that were supposed to protect the vulnerable. To the people (not just police) who are in a position of power, and abuse it... go rot at the bottom of the sea for all the pain and suffering you have caused you vile monsters.",1

[Long explanation:](https://www.reddit.com/r/TheseFuckingAccounts/comments/gswy41/heres_some_info_on_a_seemingly_surging_spam/)

It may not seem like it, but this comment and others almost exactly like it are sharing seriously devious spam links.

The link goes to a Google redirect to another random URL shortener to a redirect. Ends up at ""imgcer"", which is... totally legit.

Here's what the site loads when you load it up: https://imgur.com/a/Uu4eM8a Chock full of hidden ads, a hidden iframe with a crypto site loads silently in the background, title of the page says something about a crypto currency in the title, bleugh. For the most part the video loads and that's all you see. Your browser, however, is loading other junk in the background that is making the person who owns the site (apparently out of Kenya from the whois report on the domain listing) money in a way that goes against Google AdSense's terms of service, and is done in a way that I am personally calling malicious.

The same stuff used to happen with t-shirt bots. They would (possibly still do) reply to comments on popular pictures with stuff like ""source:"" and a link to a shady crappy t-shirt store that was obviously automatically made just from that post to make a quick buck.

This would seem to be an evolution on that, with previous Google redirects even including the word shirt for some crazy reason, that makes money off of you through garbage ad practices.

We ended up getting a bunch of cool shit, like 50 dollar gift cards for each kid, and random gifts. I bought Harvest Moon  for the N64 at a fred meyers, it was fuckin rad. Well, it must have been funded by the local police and fire Department. Which is cool as well, our local news station ran a segment, which showed the  police officers and firemen bringing all these gifts into our small apartment. It was all really great. But one cop kept in contact with my mom, and they ended up going out on a few dates. He was higher up in the department, at least thats what I remember from 15+ years ago. She stopped dating him after a few months. We had been through domestic violence as a family before. It was the main reason we needed help for christmas. When everybody asked her why she stopped dating this man that helped bring us christmas her reasoning was if he beat her, who would she call? He seemed like a great dude to me, and I haven't thought of this since it happened.",0

Wife of officer charged with murder of George Floyd announces she's divorcing him,14,fsahqtg,"Actually, that’s not what the report is saying. It’s saying that Floyd didn’t die because Chauvin’s knee closed his airway. Floyd died because the position that Chauvin forced him into (including the knee) reduces your ability to take in oxygen. If someone puts a knee on your neck that way, your blood flow is restricted AND you can’t take a full breath. This is made worse when you’re scared and stressed, and therefore using more oxygen than normal. And maybe if you have a pre-existing condition where your heart doesn’t work as well as it should anyway (although you’d think that would have showed up in the autopsy). Floyd’s brain was ultimately starved of oxygen even though his trachea was not constricted, and that’s why he died. Positional asphyxia. 

There are a few doctors on Twitter who explained it better than I did, but that’s the upshot.

But at any rate, if I read correctly, this actually makes the case against Chauvin stronger, because it would be one thing to say “Oh, Chauvin didn’t realize he was kneeling on Floyd’s windpipe,” which would be absurd but here we are. But instead it’s like, “Chauvin put him in a position that everyone already knows is dangerous because it can kill people. It’s against the rules for that reason, and he did it anyway.“ Fits the definition of 3rd degree murder pretty neatly.",0

Wife of officer charged with murder of George Floyd announces she's divorcing him,40,fsacl1q,"DITTO. I have an actual medical condition that causes seizures, memory loss, brain fog, and has briefly caused periods of hallucinations, paranoia, and psychosis, which were terrifying and shameful. 

I would hope that the love of my life who knows my heart and soul wouldn’t see that and go “you were a disgusting person all along I’m leaving you.”

Edit: I sincerely do not think my medical condition would induce a state where I could physically maim or kill someone. But I can tell you so many people in my life gaslit the shit out of me, were abusers themselves and vilified me for a medical problem I informed them fully about, and it made those flares 100x more severe. My disease is stress-mediated and that added stress of being immediately lambasted and re-traumatized by others at my most vulnerable times sent me skyrocketing and physically damaged my entire body.

Wife of officer charged with murder of George Floyd announces she's divorcing him,45,fsapz9q,"Yeah it's a very complex issue because the most concerning part right now is the justified distrust the afro american population has towards police officers. The fact people who truely want to do good policing either let their principles crumble to continue their work, try to speak out and get the blue wrath or just quit because neither is an option don't help this situation

Everyone who knows about a corrupt officer should automatically be charged the same. There should be an existential threat to know a fellow officer did something wrong and not report it but the opposite is the case - reporting it causes the existential threat instead of remaining silent. Corrupt officers should know that the second another cop finds out they are fucked - this has to become the norm. 

On the other hand alot of impoverished afro american communities would benefit from high police attention - the good kind. Where criminals get locked up and the law abiding population can count on the PDs help like everyone else. 

Maybe there has to be a temporary statute that only permits former longterm residents of an area (e.g. 5 years) to patrol said area or another way to ensure you can dispatch police officers that are trusted to do a good job by said communities.

My mom had to wait until she had enough hours at work to make it financially before she could initiate divorce proceedings.

We lived up a holler (a long private road) and I had to walk it every morning and evening to get to and from my school bus stop.  He would park along the holler road and lay his service weapon on the dash of his car, and stare daggers at me as I walked by.  In one of their last conversations he threatened to break in some night, tie my mom and I up, douse the place with gas and set the house on fire.

I was the only Male of the four children so he nearly always took out aggression on me. As I got older in my teens, he began to taunt me with hitting my mother and sisters to provoke a reaction. Eventually after witnessing a few incidents he took it to far. One day I came home late after curfew 10pm. He was incensed and choked me and stepped on my throat while I was sleeping later that night. My mom heard and ran into the room to stop him. He slapped her so hard her head bounced off the drywall. My younger sister by two years came out with the phone and said ""911 its dialing"". This never happened, he always threatened the world if we called. We would go to jail, he would lose his job and we'd be homeless, they would believe us, etc... He fake punched my sister and she didn't flinch. She called him a coward, and he lost it. He then grabbed her neck. I remember very little of that night. But, I do remember me lunging at him and getting him into a chokehold in my sisters doorway.  I remember him struggling and almost getting loose. Just then my dog Scamp grabbed a death hold of his thigh and tearing him to shreds.

"Kanye West removed from Illinois Presidential ballot after nearly 2,000 invalid signatures discovered",63,g0t8we7,"Fun fact:

 cases of petition fraud like this are included in ""voter fraud"" numbers (edit: apparently to inflate them.)

Even with this addition, total vote fraud cases for 2018 totalled 1290, out of around 100,000,000. 

Of all things the [heritage foundation compiles these](https://www.heritage.org/voterfraud) and lists the charges by each state, look at them, most are offenses of this nature. It's ironic that thier own list contradicts thier claim of ""swelling numbers"" 

Another interesting tidbit:

many of the individual actual voter fraud cases are committed by Republicans who are driven by the exaggeration of fraud to ""counter"" what they Percieve as inevitable despite overwhelming contrary evidence.

[Like this case](https://www.wftv.com/news/local/lake-county/investigation-underway-after-lake-county-election-officials-receive-fraudulent-voter-applications/6K6DKCUR45EKBKR66WSBH3HYEY/) where a woman, possibly a group investigators believe, changed nearly 120 voter registrations from Democrat to Republican by falsifying information.

It appears that fear mongering about voter fraud is more of a cause of it then the actual fraud itself.

Edit 2: if you review the list, you'll notice that not only are a vast majority not actual vote fraud, but didn't even occur on 2018 as the heading claims, from what I've reviewed there are cases as far back as 2002 on this list.

The cognitive decline bit isn't hard to see either, in that his word-choice/vocabulary is relatively small, and getting smaller as stress, diet and age combine with bad health, and diminish his capacities day by day.

It is one of the reasons he simply can't navigate a simple conversation around Covid-19 or bad economic data, or really , anything not objectively positive. In these books and ways of thinking, (Positive Thinking/Atlas Shrugged/Ayn Rand narratives) nothing like Covid-19 can ever happen or be dealt with, no real tragedy can, it just fucks up the whole narrative notion, philosophical outlook. 

You can't just ""be positive"" or ""be the superior person"" when you can't breath because your on a respirator on account that someone you never meet coughed in a room 3 hours before you even got there.",0

For the curious but lazy/non-navigating/skimming/no frills or ads/what-have-you/etc readers;



>Amid various reports that Republican and Trump-affiliated political operatives are trying to get Kanye West onto various state ballots for November’s presidential election, the billionaire rap superstar indicated, in an interview by text today, that he was in fact running to siphon votes from the presumptive Democratic nominee, Joe Biden.
Asked about that directly, West said that rather than running for president, he was “walking,” quickly adding that he was “walking . . . to win.”
When it was pointed out that he actually can’t win in 2020—that he won’t be on enough ballots to yield 270 electoral votes, and that a write-in campaign isn’t feasible—and thus was serving as a spoiler, West replied: “I’m not going to argue with you. Jesus is King.”

>West rebuffed various attempts to clarify who was driving his ballot access or strategy and whether it’s being coordinated by or with Republican-affiliated officials. He does, however, appear to have a continuing relationship with the Trump White House. West says that he’s “designing a school within the next month” and that “I’m meeting with Betsy DeVos about the post-Covid curriculum.” (The Secretary of Education’s press office hadn’t responded to a request for comment by the time we published.)
“I like Kanye very much,” President Trump told reporters at the White House yesterday. “No, I have nothing to do with him getting on the ballot. We'll have to see what happens.”

>West’s intentions have come under increased scrutiny this week, following reports by CNN, New York, the New York Times and others, about efforts by GOP political operatives to get him onto several ballots, including states like Wisconsin that could be pivotal in deciding the next president. West has been a vocal Trump supporter, including visiting the president in the Oval Office. Texts from West to me earlier this summer repeatedly ended with the sign-off “Trump 2020,” and a fist raised high. West’s recent actions have also drawn public focus, given his bipolar disorder—and many, including his wife, Kim Kardashian-West, have expressed concern about his mental health.

>West did not respond when asked whether he feels he’s being used. When I pointed out to West that the slapdash operation to get him on the ballot, which includes one operative previously arrested for voter fraud and multiple West “electors” from the same address, didn’t feel like a Kanye West production, West replied that it was a “God production.”

>In a wide-ranging interview with Forbes last month about his political aspirations, West, who has never voted before, laid out a platform for his “Birthday Party” that included a pro-life plank that alleged that Planned Parenthood was placed in cities by white supremacists, a management style patterned on the fictional country of Wakanda in Black Panther and anti-vaccine conspiracy theories. In that interview, West also claimed that he was dumping Trump. “I am taking the red hat off, with this interview.” His reason: “It looks like one big mess to me. I don’t like that I caught wind that he hid in the bunker.”

>However, he was reticent to criticize Trump besides that. “Trump is the closest president we’ve had in years to allowing God to still be part of the conversation,” he said.

>And West was eager to criticize Biden, and expressed comfort with the idea of doing damage to the former vice president’s White House chances. “I’m not denying it; I just told you.”",0

This is not exactly what happened. Basically, different counties in Florida were recounting the votes under different standards, and so the Florida Supreme Court held that this violated the Equal Protection Clause and actually ordered a statewide recount under more uniform standards. The case went to the U.S. Supreme Court, and 7 justices agreed that the original recount violated the Equal Protection Clause due to the different recounting standards. The 5 conservative justices, however, ultimately voted to overturn the Florida Supreme Court's decision, claiming that the recount would take too long.

"Kanye West removed from Illinois Presidential ballot after nearly 2,000 invalid signatures discovered",239,g0ttnch,"A big chunk of America is primarily motivated by ""I want the bad people to suffer.""

Who the bad people are just depends on their ideological views, but you can see this effect from the fact that they don't want changes to prevent things, they just want ""bad"" people to suffer. 

A lot of Americans would rather we locked up every abortion provider and patient no matter the cost, rather than spend a ton amount of money providing contraceptives. Even if you can show them the evidence that sex ed and contraceptives are the best method to prevent abortions. They'd rather people have back alley abortions as long as they get to punish the desperate people who do that.

Same with poverty and mental health, they are fine with spending tons of money to incarcerate and abuse the poor and mentally ill, but the second you suggest using public funds for treatment and jobs programs they are furious.

Also with capital punishment, many people will acknowledge that we kill innocent people due to flaws in the legal system, but they're ok with those deaths if the really bad people die too.

Same with ""the war on terror"", we'll happily spend trillions and ultimately create more terrorists and that's fine with this group of people but if you dare to suggest we should provide aid to help stabilize those countries, or accept refugees caused by our actions they'll become apoplectic and call you all kinds of names.

They went to the bank and withdrew all their money (~$4500) for no reason at all, and just started driving with no destination in mind. After being on the road for hours they stopped at a gas station, and while sitting in the car, a bum came over and asked if they could spare any change. Without hesitation, they grabbed the envelope containing the $4500 and handed it over to the bum, thinking it was some kind of fateful event that was supposed to happen.

 They started driving again, and eventually after realizing what a horrible mistake it was, they stopped and pulled over on the side of the highway. They got out of the car, and laid down on the ground in one of the lanes, hoping to get run over. Thankfully since it was the middle of the night, there was no one else on the road, so nothing happened -- and they got back in the car and drove home, while having to face the torment of what they'd done, wondering how they were going to pay the bills and rent next month.

"Black woman shot and killed after Kentucky police entered her home as she slept, family says",2504,fqg41jf,"Similarly, Police in Houston did a no knock raid, shooting and killing a couple after obtaining a warranty based on totally fabricated evidence from an informant that didn't even exist. They broke in, plain clothes, shot the dog, shot the couple, shot each other, and claimed that the old guy that they killed managed to shoot 5 of them with a revolver vs all of them with guns blazing. The union president (and current national FOP vice president, Joe Gamaldi) went on to say:

""Enough is enough. And if you're the ones that are out there spreading the rhetoric that police officers are the enemy, just know, we've all got your number now. We're going to be keeping track of all ya'll, and we're going to make sure that we hold you accountable every time you stir the pot on our police officers."" 

Other Houston police union officials have tweeted things such as that the couple are ""still dirtbags"" even after the fabricated warrant came to light (and untagged drugs were found in the lead officers car, used to plant). 

The officer most responsible for the raid had a 34 year career, with hundreds of cases now under review, and several overturned after it came to light he has made arrests and got convictions for years on completely fabricated evidence (as well as pocketing money for fake informants). He has since been charged with murder of the couple in the Harding street raid. 

So when you think about how bad no knock raids are, just remember, some of the top officials of the national fraternal order of police not only support them, they actively threaten anyone that speaks against such tactics (or really anything that isn't licking police officers boots). Since the DA has pressed charges against the officers, the local union has become increasingly vocal about ""activist DAs""

The New Jim Crow


Police and DA have been given the most blanket field judgement of any state officials by our Supreme Court. In some respects, they have more power than state governors. 


Simply put, their judgement, their gut, their instinct, as upheld by Supreme Court Case law, allows DAs and police real time judgement to execute law in a very carte blanche way when prosecuting the war on drugs. 


Why? Because that is how you can continue institutional bias in a color blind way. No matter the race of the DA or Cop, they are going to orient the state to come down hard on poor people and minorities and divert resources away from rich crime. Because its harder and they could lose the case. 

The Supreme Court has pursued this strategy since the Nixon administration to allow the federal government to have a reason to send federal money to state police forces and prosecutor offices, to ""fight drug crime"". 


If their isn't overwhelming crime sprees to stop, Republicans would have to actually do something about income inequality and insitutional racism in housing and the finance industry.

>There are other factors researchers have identified as impacting police violence rates. More racial segregation predicts more police violence (https://bu.edu/sph/2018/02/05/police-shootings-reflect-structural-racism/). **So does receiving military weapons from the feds** (https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/full/10.1177/1065912918784209
).

>Despite the US govt’s unwillingness to track police violence, we now have comprehensive data on killings by police via WaPo, http://mappingpoliceviolence.org & http://fatalencounters.org. While we don’t have enough data on non-fatal violence, we can learn a lot from the data we *do* have...

>When we break down the data by city, there are massive differences in police violence rates per population. St Louis, OKC and Orlando consistently have the highest rates of police violence. Killings are 3x less frequent in SF or Philly, 4x less in Detroit. http://mappingpoliceviolence.org/cities

>Who’s impacted by this violence? Black and brown people. This chart shows the race of unarmed people killed by police in major cities from 2013-19. Almost everyone was Black or Latinx. Black people are 3x more likely than whites to be killed by police & more likely to be unarmed.

>Among places that reduced police shootings, SF, Philly, Chicago, Denver, San Jose, LA, Phoenix and Baltimore made their use of force policies more restrictive during this period. Many had DOJ investigations. & many reformed enforcement of drugs/low level crime, reducing arrests.

>This is consistent with previous research finding departments with more restrictive use of force policies (http://useofforceproject.org) and DOJ interventions predict reduced police violence. Despite this, the Trump admin has stopped these DOJ investigations. https://vice.com/en_us/article/kznagw/jeff-sessions-is-walking-away-from-the-best-way-to-reduce-police-shootings

>Importantly, cities that reduced police shootings did so regardless of levels of crime. Crime rates (including violent crime rates) actually went up slightly in major cities during this period - but police shootings declined consistently with a 41% reduction during this time.

>On the other hand, having more Black officers is NOT associated with reducing police violence in most studies (some studies suggest more women on the force can help tho). Implicit bias training also hasn’t been shown to make a real difference. But a factor that DOES matter is...

>THE ACCOUNTABILITY SYSTEM. Just as some depts have higher violence rates, some officers have higher violence rates too. In Columbus, 6% of officers commit 50% of all use of force. When the system fails to hold them accountable it causes MAJOR problems...

>See now we can track how police misconduct spreads. And officers in close proximity to officers who have records of misconduct end up being 4x more likely to use force & 5x more likely to shoot someone. We can *contact trace* police violence like a virus. https://theintercept.com/2018/08/16/chicago-police-misconduct-social-network/

>Accountability systems work if they intervene & remove officers BEFORE misconduct spreads/escalates. But only 7% of excessive force complaints are upheld/result in discipline and 1% of killings result in prosecution. So these officers remain on the force. https://stories.usatodaynetwork.com/data_stories/police-use-of-force-data-a-huge-mess-across-the-u-s/

>Here too, data helps us understand how to increase accountability and decrease police violence. Misconduct complaints are more likely to be upheld when depts have body cams (video=key) but much less likely to be upheld in depts with police union contracts. https://gothamgazette.com/city/9167-initial-report-shows-benefits-and-challenges-of-nypd-body-camera-program-for-watchdog-agency

>This is because police union contracts are where the accountability system is set. Most contracts purge misconduct records, restrict misconduct investigations and help officers overturn discipline and get reinstated after being fired for misconduct. http://checkthepolice.org

>In fact, police depts with union contracts that grant more procedural protections to officers accused of misconduct are:
1) more likely to be reported for misconduct
2) less likely to uphold misconduct complaints
3) more likely to kill unarmed people https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=3246419

>So the contracts matter, and they need to be re-negotiated to increase levels of accountability and to reduce police violence. But what about the exceedingly low rate of officers being prosecuted? Well, we know more about this topic now than we did 5 years ago. For example...

>While only 1% of all killings by police result in officers being charged with a crime, this 1% isn’t evenly distributed. There are a handful of places that routinely charge officers while almost every other place fails to do so. And those places tend to have Black prosecutors.

>We still don’t know what tactics these prosecutors are using to secure indictments in these cases, but electing prosecutors (esp. Black prosecutors) who genuinely care about holding police accountable is important. This + video evidence are factors that can make the difference.

>So we now know:
>1) which depts have the worst police violence rates & which are reducing it
>2) a set of interventions/factors associated with reducing this violence and increasing accountability

>By continuing to study & scale up what works we can end police violence nationwide.

>Grossman at one point tells his students that the sex they have after they kill another human being will be the best sex of their lives. The room chuckles. But he’s clearly serious. “Both partners are very invested in some very intense sex,” he says. “There’s not a whole lot of perks that come with this job. You find one, relax and enjoy it.”

Like ""big black guy punched a small pretty college girl"". Of course he's going to lose the case, moreso if he's scary and she cries and stuff. 


But if all you get are the facts: ""person A stole person B's wallet.  Person B chased person A down and punched person A in order to get their property back and then left the scene"", then he might get a fair trial. 


Likewise, if the original story was told without jobs being mentioned, it would be ""three people (A B C) broke into a home and the home owner D shot person B. Persons A and C shot person E, who is person D's spouse.  E was killed, and D is accused of murder.""

Any reasonable person would say ""wtf?  A B C are the murderers""

WELL then after sentencing you hear this- ""According to U.S. Attorney David Nahmias, the sentences of Junnier and Smith were reduced after they provided information to assist in the prosecutions of the other ex-officers."" …. So the cops who did shoot and kill this woman got reduced sentences for snitching on the cop who didn't shoot??

Huh.  I've worked in a fair range of industries, and I've had some stressful jobs.  A couple of them were far higher on the ""most dangerous jobs"" list than police officers.  Once I was overseeing a seasonal agricultural operation that demanded 100+ hours a week of coordinating dozens of workers during particularly inclement weather, and after several weeks of it I thought I was going to go insane from the pressure and non-stop stress.  I once worked security at a rough place in town and had to intervene in some physical altercations more than once, one which involved a broken bottle that sent a guy to the hospital and another to jail with an attempted murder charge, and I was up until 4 AM talking to police, and then cleaning up blood.

Not once did I go into a tirade about securing assault weapons to engage in the mass murder a specific ethnic group in a fantasy civil war.  Not even close.  I think the worse I did was neglect to walk my dog after a shift because I was just too exhausted to stay awake.

This dude isn't stressed out, he's a racist, psychopathic terrorist.  Glad he's fired, but disturbed that he'll still be out there, still thirsting for blood.

In fact, society would be better off by orders of magnitude if everyone who was as incompetent as you are were gone. You do not deserve the support or respect afforded to you by being a citizen of your own country, and any nation you are a part of is made correspondingly worse by your presence.

Of the few human beings which are truly worthless, you make a convincing case that humanity should die out and make way for something better. Death would be too extreme for you, but I hope that one day you can experience the unreasoned prejudice you exercise in the police force first hand on the receiving end. Then, perhaps, once you find through your confusion that there IS no reason you're being mistreated, perhaps you can finally understand why you are currently such a piece of shit.

I genuinely hope that whatever family was born from your tainted loins can cast aside your influence and grow up to be more useful and human than you are, rather then the growing cancer more copies of you would metaphorically represent.

Fuck you, officer. There are no more words I can even type to fully explain my hatred. Thinking about you and your stupid actions and beliefs has left me angry and embittered even while I was having a good day. So thank you, officer, for being so utterly repugnant in your every aspect to make people's day worse not by interacting with them, but simply by your reputation. Congratulations, you've managed to continue the American politics tradition of turning a step forward into a backflip into a noose. Fuck you.

It’s reeeeaaalll real fucking bad

This was only caught due to an audit of a police cruiser recording. They literally stumbled upon this. Meaning the shit they try to hide is probably much worse.

Also, Wilmington has a black police Chief now that the officers reference here. And they discuss other black officers. 

Never forget, Wilmington, my hometown and the town I sit in today, is home to the only successful coup of an elected American government in 1898 by armed white insurrectionists: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wilmington_insurrection_of_1898",0

"Fired Wilmington cop: “We are just going to go out and start slaughtering them f—— ni—–. I can’t wait.

In the years leading up to [1898](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wilmington_insurrection_of_1898), black people had been elected to various public offices in Wilmington and had some success in business and such. White Democrats conspired together to murder black people in the city and overthrow the black / Republican local government, resulting in the deaths of somewhere between 60 and 300 people (the local media and state and local governments were complicit in the murders/coup, so records are not fantastic; the whole thing was falsely labeled a ""race riot"" for decades). 

I researched the 1898 massacre in college and the newspaper articles demonizing black people and advocating racial violence are some of the most hauntingly evil things I've ever read. And now cops in the same city are fantasizing about the same sort of atrocities more than a century later.",1

Sorry but assuming they're all equally racist is only prudent at this point, especially if you were a minority and had to interact with them.

The fact that ""races"" are a [made up political concept](https://www.uni-jena.de/en/190910_JE_en), so people can stereotype and hate on each other, needs to be communicated and addressed. There is no reason to ask for a fake ""race"" on an official document.

The whole patriotic indoctrination needs to come under question as well. You are witnessing the result of decades of US propaganda. Contrary to public opinion most of those racists didn't choose to be racist. They were manipulated with highly effective [propaganda techniques](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Propaganda_techniques#Specific_techniques). They are basically brain washed.

The Lumbee actually led a mob/riot against the Klan who tried to setup a headquarters in Robeson country and ran them out back in the Jim crow era. That and the fact that the most badass American outlaw (who is sadly unfortunately not very well known nowadays, but was easier much more of a Western hero than any outlaw) was a Lumbee who would make Django unchained look like baby's first plantation burning. Henry Lowry was the most wanted man in America for nearly 30 years and never caught, because of his legacy of burning down southern plantations en masse while the Lumbee were being enslaved during the civil war (Yes, you read that right - the Confederates were actively enslaving people DURING the war).

While the Lumbee were being enslaved and lands seized, he (a Lumbee) formed a ragtag multiracial militia/gang (Lumbee, white and black) that raided southern plantations across NC. He would show up at the churches of the plantation owners (when he knew they weren't armed, because church) and warn them and their community that he was going to raid/burn their plantation - and then well do so.

Afterwards, he would distribute anything he stole to the local community of natives and poor blacks and whites. He once fought an entire platoon of Confederate home guard in just a canoe and his knowledge of the swamp and came out the victor. After killing a Confederate militiaman related to someone he knew, he quietly snuck into his home and actually apologized for killing his son... and continued to fight Confederate homeguard troops and went onto show up in people's homes of people he killed in order to apologize for their deaths. A complete badass and its a shame that he isn't talked about as one of the top American outlaws in American history instead of the actually more boring characters like Billy the Kid or Jesse James.",0

When Piner talked about going out and killing black people during a race war, Moore said he wouldn't do that. And when Piner continued talking about murdering another black person, Moore responded with ""you're crazy."" 

While it's obvious that Moore is definitely racist, he seemed to gauge how racist he was going to sound by playing off the racist as fuck remarks of Piner. But even when Piner went all-out with his racism by excitedly talking about wanting to murder black people, even Moore couldn't agree with him. That's how fucking insanely racist Piner is, his rhetoric was way too fucked up even for his fellow racist coworker. And to seal the deal about Piner's insane bullshit, he didn't deny saying any of that shit, and tried to blame his behavior on the stress of the current political climate...

Just the same excuses that all of those white people who have called the cops on black people minding their own business. If you claim that you only said racist shit because you were stressed or fearful, then you're actually just straight up racist.",0

A little over a decade later, there was a disputed election that Congress had to decide. Republicans held the majority and Democrats held a minority. At the time, the Republicans were the liberal party (dominating the North) and Democrats were the conservative party (dominating the South). Despite this ideological difference with today, apparently they had about as much integrity as the modern Republican party: [in 1877](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Compromise_of_1877), Republicans traded an end to Reconstruction for the opportunity to get Rutherford Hayes in the White House, who had a relatively mediocre and uneventful presidency.

I get some folks are poor, uneducated, indifferent or whatever, but he’s a fraud on an almost Chaucerian scale and does nothing to disguise it. If life had background music, every time he appeared you’d hear that creepy sort of suspenseful music that horror movies have whenever the baddie is going to do something terrible. 

I’m confused that so many Americans can’t seem to take him at face value for the fool and fraud he so clearly is. I think after he was elected , the rest of the world collectively looked at each other, shrugged and said ‘Really?’

This is very concerning, because it is explicitly saying that hate is tolerated if it comes from a particular side. But also, more concerning is understanding what constitutes hate from disagreement. Saying that you do not agree with a topic/outlook/tweet/etc can be seen as hate speech.

the_donald has been one of reddit's most controversial communities, with debunked conspiracy theories, xenophobic memes and threats against public liberal figures, the_donald has been criticized as one of the worst subreddits there is.

Many users were banned from reddit in 2017 from the_donald and other hate subs for support of the Charlottesville ""Unite The Right"" Rally which resulted in the death of 32-year-old anti-racism protester Heather Heyer.

the_donald has been largely supported by right wing figures such as Mike Cernovich, Jack Posebiec and Milo Yiannapoulos, who is an honorary moderator.

Ironically , the_donald was quarantined back in 2019 for criticizing the police and threating to kill them during a protest in Oregon over a climate change bill where Republicans literally fled the state and allied with a far-right militia

The population of the United States? The population of the ""Western world""? The population of the globe?

I think most people recognize that it's just thinly veiled way of saying ""*You're allowed to post hate-content against whites and Christians, but we recognize that actually saying it would get us negative publicity, so we're using* ***coded language*** *instead.*""

Unfortunately, the subscribers had a tendency to brigade right-wing subs and that's against Reddit's rules (although r/t_d got away with it for a long time). The show's hosts hated the sub and tried to distance themselves anyways.

"Reddit, Acting Against Hate Speech, Bans ‘The_Donald’ Subreddit",331,fwebexl,"I think this refers to the podcast and political comedy group called ""Chapo Trap House.""

It's name is from the ~~Columbian~~ Mexican police takedown of the drug cartel leader, El Chapo.

The politics and humor are, I think, called ""dirty left."" (correction: dirtbag left) This humor is in a contrarian-libertarian satirical tradition of publications like National Lampoon from the 1970s to 80s or maybe even Spy magazine from the early 1990s. They also just try to be as crass and offensive as hell to everyone. I find some of it hilarious.

The Chapo Trap House folks were (still are, I guess) deep in the tank for Bernie.

(Note: libertarianism is also the opposite of authoritarianism, but not in the same sense. For example, progressives and left-libertarians are pretty similar, but both would disagree with right-libertarians (anarcho-capitalists) on economic policy. It's not that they disagree on whether egalitarianism is good (in contrast to authoritarians, who reject it as a principle), it's that they disagree on [what it means](http://www.businessdisabilityinternational.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/equality-vs-equity.jpg).)",0

The other is a PPP poll just after the weird ""alternative fact"" Bowling Green Massacre by Kellyanne Conway. It showed that a stunning HALF of republicans believed the BGM was a real even that killed people and thus justified the travel ban.

Also this was right around the time when Rupert Murdoch got the idea for Fox News, he wanted a channel that would represent conservative viewpoints and start a propaganda movement to prevent another removal from office like what happened with Nixon.

Murdoch has succeeded in helping to polarize the country, into an us vs them mentality using literal fake news in some cases, or just incredibly bias news in most others.

She only had great things to say about him, and reminisced sadly at the end how his health and mental state was declining.

According to her they had a reunion a year or two ago, and its tradition for all the Bunnies to wait downstairs and greet Hef when he would appear at the top of the spiral staircase with his big red robe and pipe. This last year, they were all waiting at the bottom and Hef appeared, looking confused and said ""Who the hell are you lot!?"" and they replied ""We're your Bunnies Hef!"" He looked confused a bit longer and shrugged and said ""Wow I must have done pretty well in life""

Like I said it this was according  to her, like hearing any story from a stranger on a flight, or anyone from the internet, you gotta take things with a grain of salt.

When he was in his late 80's they upped the price quite a bit and he cancelled it.  Some poor woman called him to ask why he had cancelled, pointing out to him that the price may have gone up, but now he'd get a few videos included.  He told her that he was 80 something years old, had been getting the magazine for 40 years and at his age, he really did just read it for the articles and he didn't give a damn about any dirty videos.  She must have looked at his account and realized how old he was because she dropped the price back down to what he'd been paying.

Then when i was in college, i'd come home to visit and before I left he'd call me over, slip me twenty bucks and some of those magazines in a bag telling me to bring them to my guy friends at school.  That may seem a little weird - giving porn to your granddaughter to give to her guy friends - but if you knew him you'd realize it was a good deed on his part - figuring my friends couldn't afford to buy their own.  Then again maybe he figured if they were busy with those they'd leave his granddaughter alone. LOL


In the last month of his life he was in a nursing home and showing signs of dementia.  I was going to visit him and wanted to bring him something but couldn't figure out what.  My uncle went into his attic and pulled out some old playboys from the 70's and gave them to me to bring to grandpa.  Some may think this is weird but i remember the smile on his face when he pulled them out of the bag.  He didn't know where he was or why he was there but those magazines he knew.  Was the last time I saw him alive and I'm glad that brought a smile to his face.  

EDIT - since you are enjoying my memory of Grandpa - I should show you what a badass he was.  Here he is delivering milk in a flood in Lowell MA [My Grandpa - Gordon Cutler is the one standing](https://i.imgur.com/Da0nFVo.jpg)

He was a short guy, holding a martini in front of his Gold Coast home. I was always appalled back then , and if you were a woman back then you threw your anger at guys like Hefner and other men who you thought were misogynistic fellows. Well, I mellowed with time, and I think of all of the great articles and brilliant essays that Playboy printed, and my feelings towards Hef and his magazine became more comical and I left that stage of anger to recognize the magazine as a terrific mouthpiece for the civil rights movement at the time, and the forum for writers and artists to show their ideas. I.E., I stopped disliking Hefner and saw him as just a person who had grown up, as I had, in the repressed 1950s, when it was taboo to be so many things. His porn is mild and silly to me now, and I recognize, despite his weirdness for dressing women as rabbits, his contributions to the world of literary brilliance. He published things no one would publish at the time. Believe me, you had to live in the 50s to see how daring his magazine was...including the porn, which now merely looks to me like any catalogue for Victoria's Secret.  So, well, good journey to you , Hef. Thanks for the articles. Yep , I bought your magazine for the articles...for real...signed, Grandmother now and former angry little feminist. Now I just laugh at my former self and hope all your rabbit ladies had good pension plans. Salut!",0
"American Icon and Playboy Founder, Hugh M. Hefner, Has Died",90,dnm2l0y,"It's funny. In the age of the Internet, with more hard core porn available than anyone could possibly hope for, Hef and Playboy seem pure and innocent in comparison. 

Back in the day, when I was in grade school, a Playboy magazine was the Holy Grail. We lived to see one. The women were beautiful, but never trashy. Now, we're all a click or two from every extreme of sexual excess we can possibly think of. The magic is gone.

Vietnam, women's rights, LGBT rights, etc. Playboy magazine is more than just a magazine; it is a symbol. I want to say Rest In Peace Mr. Hefner.

There's that other part of Her that was really progressive, politically and he helped evolve a lot of people's minds and relationships, his TV shows both latenight and reality were intriguing.

It had been years since I saw my grandmother so interested in anything, but at that moment I could tell she was listening to something from her past.

Hefner, Has Died",67,dnm9me9,"I also read Linda Lovelace's book and Hef didn't come out looking great in that either...in fact he wanted to watch Linda Lovelace have sex with a dog. If you know anything about Linda's story, she was horribly abused and forced into prostitution by her scum bag boyfriend. Deep Throat made millions and she made a few hundred dollars. Her boyfriend forced her to do a dog porno at gunpoint. And when they went to the mansion for a party after Deep Throat came out, her boyfriend told Hugh Hefner about how he could get a dog to have sex with her. I guess he was extremely eager and into it, so he brought them to a room where him and the boyfriend watched as they attempted to get the dog to have sex with Linda. At this point Linda had learned to scare the dog off in a subtle way, so that her boyfriend wouldn't beat her after. I don't know who provided the dog, but it was at the mansion and I doubt they brought a dog to his party. 😦

The other part that creeped me out about Hugh is that he wouldn't let the Holly, Kendra, and Bridget leave to see their families like ever. The families had to come there. I recall one of them saying they weren't allowed to leave for a family trip. And when they left the mansion they had to tell security where they were going and it was recorded. They also had curfews every day. I remember the girls had to do a trip to Vegas in one episode and I just remember them being really nervous about getting back on time. I think they were only gone for the day or 24 hours but they couldn't stay longer than that otherwise they would be kicked out or in trouble.

Everyone knows Hugh as the old, robed dude that lives in a mansion with a bunch of models but he's somewhat of a personal hero of mine for his contributions to literature and civil rights. In Playboy's heyday they published *everybody* of note, as long as the story had something to say. The counter-culture of the 60s thrived due in part to Hugh's love of the truths we find in story.

Kerouac, Murakami, tons of the sci-fi greats like Atwood, Bradbury, and Asimov,  ALL published in Playboy. He even published my all-time favorite author, Kurt Vonnegut, which is why I have [a single vintage Playboy](https://www.antichay.com/pictures/medium/22318.jpg) on my bookshelf. There was a definite kernel of truth to the whole ""I read it for the articles!"" bit that people like to do.

[Hugh also came out in support of gay rights all the way back in the 50s](https://www.advocate.com/news/daily-news/2009/08/28/hugh-hefner-gay-rights-pioneer), famously publishing the controversial short story [""The Crooked Man""](https://lostgayfiction.wordpress.com/2011/12/04/the-crooked-man-by-charles-beaumont/) by Charles Beaumont. For those that don't know, ""The Crooked Man"" takes place in a world where homosexuality is the norm and heterosexuals are oppressed. It naturally causes a media stir and when asked about it, Hugh simply replied ""If it was wrong to persecute heterosexuals in a homosexual society, then the reverse was wrong, too.""

Hugh's best known for building a media empire out of tits but his contributions to the literary world, counter-culture, and civil rights movements has made him a legendary American icon, or at least he is to me.",0
"American Icon and Playboy Founder, Hugh M. Hefner, Has Died",100,dnm1w9v,"It started to fall off, as did a lot of literary magazines. But Playboy, I think, lost some of it's bite when the libertarianism that had been essential to securing a voice for the magazine was no longer important to it. Younger readers didn't realize the fight that Hefner had gone through to develop prestige for a magazine with naked women and thought, when they first saw it, that the politics we're a little ham-handed. 

At least, that's how it was for me. But as a teenager I still picked it up whenever there was a new Updike, or Palahniuk, or King story. 

Edit: thinking a little more about it - I got older and more pretentious and stopped reading those writers. But I never really questioned the quality of writing in Playboy the way I did other magazines, I think because I knew it was the only place a lot of men were getting any sort of literature. It was like Oprah's Book Club for men, but the sort of men who specifically don't spend their days talking about what they've read lately. ",0

Going to college there was one of the best periods of my life. The folk festival was wonderful, with everyone spilling out into the streets and wonderful food and people dancing to accordion music in side streets after dark. I loved the fairy lights in the trees and the mill museums and the art studio open days. I loved the rebel chicken sandwich at the Old Court! I got married in the little park opposite what was then the Revolving Museum and it was beautiful. My whole family came from England and we had the best time.

"American Icon and Playboy Founder, Hugh M. Hefner, Has Died",257,dnmcxx9,"My grandmother had been on a decline for the past year or two. She had the memory of a goldfish. I don't mean this in an offensive way; it's just how it was. My sister brought her a coffee and my grandmother thanked her. A couple minutes later, she noticed the coffee and was surprised by it. She thanked my dad. He told her that my sister brought it. So she thanked my sister. A couple minutes later, same thing all over again. 

My uncle passed away in June. My dad did try to tell her once or twice but she just didn't react at all... at least, not outwardly. At that point, she stopped eating. She was admitted to the hospital. At one point, she said my uncle's name and then said something about him never really eating well or being in poor health. Something like that. So something did click on some level. She continued to decline. It was hard to see her begging to be brought home - not to her home where she lived for over 60 years... she wanted to go to where she lived as a teen. That was home to her. When we arrived for a visit, she also yelled at my dad for leaving her there without any clothes. She didn't understand why she was there, why she was in a hospital gown, and why she couldn't go home. The last time I saw her, she was begging for someone to help her. It was awful.

For me, I feel like one of the worst things about everything was her mental decline. My grandmother was always healthy, active, and liked to keep her mind sharp. She made a point of it. She was bright and witty. It was heartbreaking to see her in that condition. 

EDIT: Thank you for your kind words, everyone. My grandmother passed away in August after about a month in hospital. It was so hard to see her suffer. After seeing her that last time, it was somewhat easier to cope as she was finally at peace. She was a beautiful person inside and out. I will remember who she was throughout my life, not at the end.

"American Icon and Playboy Founder, Hugh M. Hefner, Has Died",14,dnm3oro,"I knew Bob Guccione briefly by way of a friend. He hosted us guys in his house for a weekend and there was zero raunchiness. The man even cooked for us even though at that time, he could no longer eat food himself. He did this all because we were friends with a woman he loved. He even put our band in a 6 page article in his magazine because of his love for our friend (we felt we were good, but not that good :)  
  
Anyway, my mom bought that mag (way over a decade ago), because she happened to be excite that her son was in a magazine. I think she thought it was going to be like Playboy... it was not. It was their raunchiest (for their standards) issue to date because the internet was making soft porn mags like Penthouse look like Readers Digest. And this one, although they had soft lenses and the artistic style you'd find in a Penthouse, was near Hustler raunchy. My mom cut out all the offensive pages and left just us and the other articles so that my little brother could read it.  
  
Anyway, I came to say that it seemed to me like the tameness of Playboy was the opposite of what was rumored to happen at the mansion. And - at least in the 2000's, well past the prime of the mag, the harder core of Penthouse was in contrast to the total tame residence that was Guccione's residence in NYC. It was a multi-story museum that housed lots and lots of fine art. There was even a golden colored piano that was said to be Judy Garland's.  Bob's big thing was conversation. He'd host a great Italian dinner and talk about world affairs. We were just a dumb band compared to who had over the years: scientists, doctors, leaders, etc.  The man was a deep thinker and I always wondered why he was lower key than Hef. ",1

For me and my friends, we hid our stuff in a sugar maple near a small creek in a little hollow about 2 miles off the road. Thing was probably 200 years old and had a decent sized tree hole about 5 feet up the trunk. We'd hide our magazines, comics, a corncob pipe my friend stole from his dad, and other cool stuff that we found from this old (I mean real old, like 100 years) trash dump in the woods. One time my friend and I found an old musket pistol but this fucking kid Timothy ratted us out to his fucking parents and his dad went to the tree and took it out and found our cigarettes. It was an old rusted to shit black powder pistol, we couldn't have hurt anyone with it but *noooo* can't have cool things. So Timothy got rocks thrown at him any time he tried to come to the tree after that, and my grandfather went to his house and demanded that they return the pistol.

They were so happy to see each other it was a real pleasure to witness that. A few minutes later, still very happy, Carrie Fisher greeted me with a huge grin and, pushing a box of cookies, told me to take one.

>The Princess stole my heart at age 7. Anybody who knows me knows #CarrieFisher was my first love. I thrilled to the adventures of #princessleia in the @starwars movies, but from '77 to '84, I was in love with Carrie Fisher herself. My bedroom was filled with Carrie Fisher pictures from any movie she was ever in (including Polaroids I took off the TV when #thebluesbrothers hit cable). I was jealous of Paul Simon when he was dating Carrie Fisher and wouldn't listen to his music until they split up. I paid to see Carrie Fisher and #chevychase in Under the Rainbow nine times when it was in theaters (mostly because Carrie Fisher was in underwear in one scene). In childhood, I committed myself to Carrie Fisher without ever meeting her the way novice Nuns commit themselves to Christ without meeting Him. Decades later, I got to tell her this when Carrie Fisher and @jaymewes were in a station wagon on the set of #jayandsilentbobstrikeback. She was gracious about hearing it for the zillionth time from the zillionth man or woman who grew up idolizing her, but wickedly added ""I'm glad to know I helped you find your light saber."" And with that, she stopped being Carrie Fisher to me and just became Carrie. That's the Carrie I'll always remember: the dutiful standard-bearer of childhood dreams with a the wicked sense of humor and a way with words. She didn't want to get paid for her role in @jayandsilentbob Strike Back; instead, she asked that we buy her these antique beaver chairs. Her reason: ""Beaver seems an appropriate currency for this movie."" When she was a guest on Season 1 of our @hulu show #Spoilers, Carrie curled up in the throne like she belonged there. And she did: after all, she was royalty. As a boy, I dreamed of marrying Carrie Fisher. As a young filmmaker, I dreamed of casting Carrie Fisher. As an adult, I dreamed of being as sharp-witted and prepossessed as Carrie Fisher. And now that Carrie Fisher is gone, I'll dream of my friend Carrie - whose entire magnificent career I was lucky enough to witness, whose honesty made me a better person, and whose spirit - like The Force - will be with us always.

She was able to use her experiences as advice to people of all walks of life about flaws and how to overcome them, she was able to influence people's actions without telling them that they should/shouldn't approach life like she did in her younger age. She influenced us, but ultimately gave us our own choice on our path through life.

Of course people should avoid cocaine etc (that's probably why she died so young), but the way she overcame and eventually talked about her illnesses and struggles is incredibly inspiring.

Her living her life in public as she did helped hugely to break down stigmas, misconceptions, and prejudices that have always haunted that community.

In regards to AEDs most people don't really know how to use them and even if they did they are only effective in specific cardiac arrhythmias (Ventricular Tachycardia and Ventricular Fibrillation) you can't just use them on anybody.

Carrie Fisher Dies at 60,29,dbosem1,"CPR in even the best circumstances doesn't always lead to good outcomes. The body conserves a lot of oxygen, but when the heart isn't pumping, it isn't getting to the brain. This is the whole point of chest compressions, to ensure the brain gets oxygen and blood. 
     
I'm not an expert on flight medicine, but I have seen many codes (cardiac/respiratory arrests) in the ICU. An average code in a hospital includes chest compressions, a good airway (usually ventilating the patient early on with a tube into their airway (if not already present) hooked up to a ventilator that gives oxygen and pressure to inflate the lungs), IV push drugs like epinephrine to kick start the heart if it has stopped (think that scene in Pulp Fiction), pressor drugs in IV drips like phenylephrine, dopamine, vasopressin, neosynephrine and epinephrine (used in both push/drip forms) to keep the blood pressure up, amioderone to knock it out of fatal arrythmias if the heart is beating inadequately and shocks for the same. Some other crap too, like sodium bicarb, but I don't feel like getting into acidosis after working all night.
     
I doubt a plane had  anything more than an AED (like a defibrillator for dummies) and somebody trained for CPR months ago, but may have never done it on a real person. I doubt they would have a whole code cart and somebody trained on intubation. I'd be really surprised if they even had access to Epi, which is central to coding a cardiac arrest patient. I'm sure they did chest compressions, of course, but as stated earlier, even in ideal conditions that is no guarantee of not suffering a hypoxic brain injury (brain doesn't get oxygen kinda like a brain-wide stroke, as opposed to localized). Doing chest compression is Hard Work and it will tire you out easily. We usually switch every three minutes, if memory serves, and I have felt it the next day. I'm not sure what to compare it to, but it's like kneading a 10 inch thick slab of dough, arms extended with enough force to dig in two inches deep, at 100 beats per minute for three minutes straight. We have a few respiratory therapists who are ripped and do some good chest compressions. I do alright, but I tire very easily. Imagine the stress of the situation, a famous person, you've never done CPR, etc. This does not make for ideal CPR. If it's one person you alternate 30 compressions with 2 breaths. The breaths are no joke either, as you have to pull the head back, extend the jaw, and hope they don't puke because they'll probably die (I mean, they probably will anyway, but more so) and you'll get puke in your mouth. I'm assuming a plane would have a bag mask though, so one would only have to make sure the mask and head were in proper position and squeeze a big football looking thing. If she was in V. Tach or V. fib (i.e. heart still beating, but too fast and/or crappy to really do anything important to keep humans alive for long), the AED could shock her, but they probably wouldn't have access to drugs to keep her blood pressure up (sick hearts that just had heart attacks don't pump so good) so that leads to hypoperfusion of the brain and other vital organs, which start to work less effectively and/or die. Organs needs enough blood pressure/oxygen to function, and below it they die. Heart = heart attack. Brain = stroke/anoxic brain injury. Livers and Kidneys are also susceptible, and can further lead an already brain dead person on a course toward dead dead. If her heart was stopped, then you're stuck doing compression the whole time unless you have access to Epi pushes to hopefully get her heart going. You may need a lot of them. Even if there were medical professionals, they presumably would have no access to her medical history, her current meds, etc. Don't have a heart attack on a plane.
      
""Machines"" don't usually keep the heart pumping after heart attacks unless they're in surgery. Initially it's man power (CPR), external pacing from wires or defibrillator pads if possible, actual heart + some type of (semi)temporary device like a balloon pump, VAD, Impella, etc. (not for use in codes, more like waiting for surgery or transplant) and most commonly actual heart/paced heart/devices + IV drips to keep the blood pressure high enough to sustain organ life. In surgery or especially sick patients (usually kids) they can be placed on ECMO, a device that bypasses the heart and lungs and oxygenates and circulates the blood for the body. Patients cannot be left on this device for too long and the most common complications are neurological. In surgery, this allows doctors to freely work on the heart while the rest of the body is kept alive, cooled down, and sedated. At the end they hook the heart back up and shock it back to life. In scary codes, the doctors may reach into a patient's chest and perform cardiac massage, i.e. compressing the heart manually instead of chest compressions. Sorry, I got side tracked.
     
The take away is that in ideal circumstances the outlook wouldn't be great. On a plane for half an hour away from critical care resources, you're looking at an even poorer prognosis for neurological recovery. Once a lot of brain is dead, that's just it. The liver and the kidneys can function on half steam to a certain extant, but once you start messing with the lizard brain you're basically dead. If you can't regulate your own body temperature or breathing, only the ICU is keeping you alive. Not a pretty picture. At that point, we can start to talk about fixing the heart, but the damage has already been done. What's the point?",0
Carrie Fisher Dies at 60,38,dboqgl6,"She stopped breathing for ~15 minutes just before the plane landed. A bystander performed CPR until they touched down. So even if the CPR held her long enough for paramedics to take her to the ICU, that's still a long time for the brain to go without oxygen.

I teach university. Because my classes (thankfully) attract the brooding, dark-color-wearing, tortured artist type, I have a lot of beloved students whom I know to be ""the best minds of [their] generation"" who smoke and have a fatalistic idea/rationalization about it.

But even though I am of the same ilk, I have never inhaled smoke from *anything* (even pot—there are other ways, you know). I was the androgynous goth boy with the clove cigarettes in my 20s, but I didn't inhale (I love the taste of cloves, and I love the look—but I probably only bought 4 packs in my life!). No real smoking, ever. 

My grandmother, one of the sharpest people I've ever known, died a very slow, lingering death, watching her mind—the thing she was most proud and confident of—deteriorate along with her body. By the time she died, she hadn't smoked in almost 20 years, but the damage had been done, according to the doctors.

Just don't start. Is that so hard? Not only is it a dirty, smelly, expensive habit, nicotine is one of the most addictive substances on Earth, and inhaling smoke is one of the most dangerous things you can do. Why bother having that first one?",0

Almost every women I've every met and talked with has had experience with sexual harassment, assault, rape, miscarriage, or abortion; and yet all of these topics are incredibly taboo to discuss, and women are often the most judgemental.   I was not happy or proud to have an abortion, I was not expecting to ever need one, but at the time it was absolutely the right decision.

Federal judge rules women can get abortion pill without doctor visits,14,fy0bh2q,"I have a question, and I'm genuinely just looking for some clarification.

Is making contraceptive as readily accessible as things like Tylenol safe? Different women have different needs, and a doctor would be able to determine which bc pills would work best for your needs and your body.

Edit: I've read the replies and truly thought about it, and I don't believe it's safe. Until a non hormonal pill is made, I believe having a doctor help guide you and help monitor you is the way we need to proceed for now.

I'm a woman and I cycled through so many birth control pills. They made my depression worse, they didn't keep regular, and/or some caused worse cramps, bleeding, and so on. It turns out I have PCOS, so I was given an IUD and metformin. That helped.

I relate to the feeling of my doctor choosing so many different pills that it felt like she was throwing a handful at a wall hoping one would stick, but I don't think I could have differently or better. My doctor rocks. 

I can't pretend that bc pills can be placed at the same level of ofc medications like cough syrup, Tylenol, allergy medications, sleep aids, and so on. I think bc pills are on the same level of anxiety and anti depressants (which I also take), though they require a more watchful eye, we basically threw a bunch of different medications at a wall seeing which ones stuck.

I'm strongly for making birth control more available to women, as I think we have the right to have full control over our reproductive health, but until something safer becomes available having a doctor prescribe them is the way things should be.",0

> The abortion pill process has several steps and includes two different medicines.

> First, you take a pill called mifepristone. This medicine stops the pregnancy from growing.  Some people feel nauseous or start bleeding after taking mifepristone, but it’s not common. Your doctor or nurse may also give you antibiotics to take to prevent infection.

> The second medicine is called misoprostol. You’ll either take the misoprostol right away, or up to 48 hours after you take the first pill — your doctor or nurse will let you know how and when to take it. This medicine causes cramping and bleeding to empty your uterus.

So the first one actually aborts the fetus. This is the actual act that kills the fetus; that’s why the doctor watches you take it. It’s the point of no return.

Fun Fact!: I actually did a little bit of research on the subject for a class project and studies show comprehensive sex ed (where they learn all about the reproductive cycle, sexual anatomy, contraception methods (including stressing abstinence being the only 100% effective method), and std education) teenage pregnancy rates and abortion rates were much lower than those of abstinence only sex-ed.

A lot of times members of a group will hate other members in order to have a good standing with those in power. 

There’s also a lot of resentment for people who don’t adhere to the same limitations. If you live your life by a set of extremely strict rules and you see someone who completely dismissed them and suffers no consequences it’ll piss you off. 

There’s also the idea of tearing others down makes you feel validated for your choices.

You do have to remember that the internet is full of quite a few vocal minorities, while most others are somewhere in the middle.

I see this comment all the time and it annoys me. I'm all for sex-ed, contraception, and condoms. Only an idiot would argue that abortions to save a mother's life or in cases of severe birth defects incompatible with life or function should be legal. Same with rape.

Federal judge rules women can get abortion pill without doctor visits,17,fxzqyn1,"Studies have shown it doesn't do shit if you've already ovulated. The FDA is lazy and was just like eehhhhh it's the same ingredient as birth control so close enough.

https://www.nytimes.com/2012/06/06/health/research/morning-after-pills-dont-block-implantation-science-suggests.html

The way birth control prevents implantation is that your body knows it's never going to ovulate. So the entire month when your uterus would normally be preparing a thicc endometrium for the egg to implant in it doesn't, cause it knows from your hormones an egg ain't coming. This is why you don't need to have a period on birth control, because there is very little lining of the uterus for you to shed. However, sometimes an egg accidentally gets released anyway and because the lining is thin it has nothing to implant in. 

Plan B is just one mega dose of birth control. You're not taking it every day the entire month, your uterus has no idea what's coming. It has been a preparing a thick uterine lining for implantation the entire time. Where is that lining supposed to go if you take plan B? Your uterus ain't gonna suck it back up inside you. You will still have the lining of your uterus there that's prime for implantation.

And as far as fertilization goes ... That's left over from the FDA reusing the birth control reasoning too. Birth control prevents fertilization by thickening the cervical mucous so the sperm can't get in. If you're taking plan B the sperms have already made their way up there most likely. Your mucous getting thickened hours later isn't gonna do shit.",0

Federal judge rules women can get abortion pill without doctor visits,36,fxzu6vi,"> That is why I don’t understand those that are against abortion, why are they making it hard for females to get contraceptives? 

Because Republican opposition to abortion isn't based in a unified and consistent principled objection, it's a political amalgamation of efforts to pander to multiple sets of principles and preferences. Originally opposition to abortion was a Catholic issue, and Catholics were predominantly Democrats. In the '70s the Republicans decided to lean in to their religious affiliation and branding as the ""Party of God"" to win over the Catholics, and abortion was the wedge they used to split them away from the Democrats. Catholics are (officially, at least) also opposed to birth control, so proposing increased availability of birth control to reduce abortion wasn't going to work.

The worst part is that Catholics *do* support a policy that would reduce abortions: increased social spending so that poor people don't have to choose between abortions and feeding their family. But that's absolutely no go territory for Republicans. So the final policy that they put forward is make abortions de facto illegal and then do absolutely nothing to reduce the need for abortions.",0

You might think ""ugh, look at that punk with all those tattoos"" and then you might think ""wait a second, they just made a choice that wouldn't be for me"" and you move on. A lot of the time, we react how we've been taught to react, and when raised with a certain type of belief (in this case, anti-abortion) and we might have subconscious emotional responses (in this case, anger or resentment of other women) that is attached to those beliefs without us realizing. It isn't until we're shown otherwise or shown new perspectives that we might face these thoughts/emotions for what their real causes are, and correct them like the tattoo example. Maybe that's just my opinion though",0
Federal judge rules women can get abortion pill without doctor visits,13,fy0b319,"I think there's another layer to this as well when you consider bodily autonomy. Let's say that the consensus is that life starts at conception, like some people believe. Does that fetus have the right to override the woman's bodily autonomy? Pregnancy and childbirth can be dangerous, traumatizing, and often lead to long term health conditions. Why is the fetus living more important than its host? When we think of organ donation, we don't say people have the right to other's organs, even if they will save their life. Because the potential donor has bodily autonomy, and it's respected. However, for some reason, this is ignored in the context of women having abortions. 

I don't think most people consciously set out to try to control women, but that's still where the road ends up. If access to abortion is made difficult or banned, women potentially don't have a choice in having a baby, whether or not they're able to care for it. They may develop mental disorders, long term physical conditions, get injured, or even die from the process of pregnancy and childbirth. And that's all before the child is born. Additionally, a lot of these issues disproportionately affect those of a lower socioeconomic status as well, continuing the cycle of disadvantage.",0

The major argument you will see, even if it isn't actually framed this way because the person making it doesn't understand it, is that of potency.

That is, if something will necessity become something else over time, unless something outside of its control befalls it, then, in many philosophic schools of thought, you would do well to think of the two states as having the same metaphysical status even if the material status at the time is different.

In the case of rape, then, potency has *already been acted upon* by an outside source, which would then supersede the potency of the bundle of cells.

Federal judge rules women can get abortion pill without doctor visits,13,fy02h57,"by the time it's more than a speck of cells, most people who do not want to have a baby would have already made a decision. fetuses that are aborted once they look more human-like are usually due to genetic issues that would lead the baby to be miscarried, still born, or die shortly after birth. sometimes, it can be due to other health issues that would lead to the woman and fetus dying at birth.  
  
  people hyperfocus on abortion due to someone not wanting the baby but it's more of a medical procedure than an elective one. if there was proper contraception education and availability abortion due to accidental pregnancy would be extremely rare. unfortunately pro-lifers are often against contraception as well since the idea of having sex before you're ready to make a baby being bad is the root of the movement.",0

Woman who lied about being raped on college campus gets jail,71,e0y7odz,"Looking at all the comments regarding innocent until proven guilty, and those who think it shouldn't be so, I felt I needed to put my two cents in.

I feel that yes there is a definitive need to treat the situation as though there is a crime that has occurred.  Equally, we must avoid any direct consequences against the accused, particularly in the case of rape, as rape accusations can get a man fired, and isolates socially from his peers, a terrible thing to happen if the man is found innocent.  Likewise, having their pleas ignores can be incredibly traumatic for the victim.

Think of it this way.  If someone came to you, and told them that their laptop had been stolen, you would of course believe them, and investigated further.  However, if someone came to you pointing the finger saying that ""this person"" stole my laptop, you would investigate the robbery with that person in mind, but would not necessarily blame that person or dole out consequence until definitive proof has been found.

Woman who lied about being raped on college campus gets jail,292,e0ydkyy,"Had something similar. Started dating a girl freshman year of college. Over summer she convinced me we should move off campus and get a place. She didn't tell me her mother would be living with us and that neither of them would pay a single bill so I decided that I was going to move back to living on campus so I didn't have to work 40hours plus engineering classes. I said I would finish out the year at the place with them then move back home for the summer.

She got mad and broke up with me and I moved into the other room asking for a month to find a new place. She agreed, but her mother decided she no longer wanted me there and called the police on me. I got forcably removed from the place with just a backpack for the week.

 I had to set up an appointment with the police to get my stuff back and was not able to look through the items to make sure they were all there while on site. Later I had found she had taken a Nintendo Wii. I called the police, and they told me it wasn't there problem and that I would need a representative to call to arrange for them to give it back or that I could take them too small claims to get it returned.

 I had one of my parents call her mother to try and resolve this peacefully which did not go over well. Shortly after their conversation I see she blasted all over Facebook that I had supposedly raped her and that she was going to get me thrown in jail.

She got the school to start an investigation. I had to have several meetings with a detective who said that I would be able to have someone present during every meeting so I had my father with me every meeting. Multiple times the investigator berated me and my father when we provided multiple forms of evidence that I wasn't even in town during the supposed attack calling me a liar and telling me to shut up.

After I was cleared and proven not guilty I was told that if I sought recompense through any means  that I would be expelled from school and arrested for it.

Even being found innocent still can negatively affect someone's life as you will still be seen as the person who was caught up in the allegations.

I am glad they are trying to get more women toncomen forward about sexual harassment and attacks, but I feel that those who lie and make claims out of revenge, anger, or even deeper deceptions in your case should honestly be punished as it makes it difficult for the real cases to be taken seriously.

I really hope someone hurries to set a proper precedent for false accusations, and actually delivers the full sentence the accused would have recieved if the false claim hadn't been discovered.

Edit: really didn't think this was gonna blow up like this, but let me clarify a few points:

I don't immediately believe the accused over the accuser, I just won't demonize the accused until evidence shows the claim to be substantiated.

For those asking for specific numbers on how many false claims is too many, it's 1. 1 false claim is enough to make me question every other accusation. Not that I don't feel every claim should be properly investigated, actual rapists should most definitely face the consequences for their actions, but I want proof before I will take the accusers side.

And finally, the reason I support the accused from the start, is because not enough people do. I feel they need more people in their corner, trying to help people keep an open mind, until such a time as proof has been given one way or the other.

Woman who lied about being raped on college campus gets jail,53,e0yt4zu,"Adding my story here just because I don’t really talk about it and haven’t really seen any threads where it’s even remotely relevant. 

Met a girl about a year ago and some change at an outdoor festival event and she found me through mutual friends on Instagram. Asked me to meet up with her later that night. I did, after drinks with my coworkers, so when we met up I was already pretty blitzed. She bought me a drink, I drank one more after that, and she suggested we go to her place. We fool around a bit and I pull out a condom asking if she wants to continue. She agrees, we do the deed with protection. Now, being drunk, whiskey dick starts taking hold at a certain point and I see the futility of continuing. I pull out, take the condom off and roll over. Throw it away, and she begins complaining asking why I did that, and what was wrong. I explained and said I’m totally fine not continuing, that it wasn’t gonna happen tonight but we could try again in the morning. Well, she apparently hadn’t had enough. We’re laying there spooning and she begins fondling me. I figure, okay we’ll see where this goes. Maybe she can get me to stand at attention and we can go for round two. She does and I ask if she has any condoms. I only had the one in my bag. She doesn’t, so I tell her that I couldn’t have sex but we could go down on each other. She begins fellating me and when I’m really getting going she moves over and kind of puts her ass on me. She asks me, while stroking me if I’m “clean.” I say, yes of course. I had been in a relationship up until the month prior and hadn’t been with anyone else. She tells me she’s “clean” and that if I was okay with it we should just do the deed unprotected. I said I wasn’t really comfortable with that and she protested, assuring me she was clean. She maneuvers herself over and pushes herself onto me, inserting me into her vagina. I pulled out pretty quickly and said no, I wasn’t cool with that. She said it was fine, did it again, and by that point I figured, okay she seems pretty sure of it, let’s just do it. We finish up, fall asleep, and I think nothing else of it. 

I tell a friend about a week later and she tells me I need to get checked, immediately. I had already planned on it, but she seemed urgent so I asked why. She tells me this girl in question gave two other people chlamydia and that I probably have it too. So I get checked that week. Sure enough, I’m positive for chlamydia. I immediately tell her and say there’s probably no way it could come from my ex because we were faithful and that I hadn’t had sex with anyone else and it didn’t go well. She accused me of giving it to her, flipped out, and to my knowledge never actually got checked. Because when pressed on whether she got tested or not, she claimed she didn’t need to because she knew she didn’t have anything. Then, a week or two later claims she did get checked and came back negative. But refused to share her results with me, claiming she didn’t have to. 

Fast forward months later and this girl goes on a campaign of accusing me of “stealthing” her which I didn’t know was a term until then, but it apparently means removing a condom during sex, without asking, or saying, and stealthily continuing having sex with that person. Then claimed that I had the STD and that I gave it to her, even though she told me she didn’t have it after being tested. 

My life has been turned upside down, people hate me In my town as a result, and I’m the one that was assaulted, technically speaking. It’s been a real shitty year because of this whole thing. False accusations are real and they’re fucked up. 

Tl;dr a girl I had a one night stand with pressured me into having unprotected sex, gave ME an STD and then accused me of giving it to her by removing a condom during sex and not telling her, even though I didn’t want to have unprotected sex and vocally protested having unprotected sex. ",0

It is so easy to ruin someone's life by making horrible accusations against them on social media. I understand the impulse for those who have legitimately been victimized and are angry, but it is just far too easy to hurt innocent people without any repercussions or recourse. We need to change laws in a way that protects both victims and the accused- I think call out posts should be treated similar to revenge porn, for starters. Make it so the accused is able to have those posts removed immediately, back that up with legal sanctions if needed. And protect the names and ID's of criminal defendants until and unless they are convicted of a crime, the same way we protect the identities of rape victims.

""In 2015 we wrote an article for ProPublica and the Marshall Project about Marie, an 18-year-old who reported being raped in Lynnwood, Wash., by a man who broke into her apartment. (Marie is her middle name.) Police detectives treated small inconsistencies in her account — common among trauma victims — as major discrepancies. Instead of interviewing her as a victim, they interrogated her as a suspect. Under pressure, Marie eventually recanted — and was charged with false reporting, punishable by up to a year in jail. The court ordered her to pay $500 in court costs, get mental health counseling for her lying and go on supervised probation for one year. More than two years later, the police in Colorado arrested a serial rapist — and discovered a photograph proving he had raped Marie.""",2

I think the guy said that ""beating the polygraph"" isn't accurate at all, you're actually attempting to beat the polygraph tech. He said he wished everyone would be stupid enough to try the thumb tack ""trick"", since the readings are so out of whack it's insanely easy to tell.

I think basically, you bring the tack, then you get to a question you're trying to lie through, and you're sitting there thinking about the tack, hoping it works, your readings are so out of whack even a blind man could tell. There was also another ""trick"" about putting anti-perspirant on your fingers because one of the readings is your perspiration  (which they apparently measure through your fingers? Who woulda thought that'd be a good place to get a perspiration reading?). But basically the test comes down to how qualified the poly tech is. You have to try and beat them, not the machine. But of course a polygraph examiner technician guy isn't gonna give up the secrets on a TV show. Unless they do?. Maybe it was all misinformation?

Bill Cosby found guilty on all sex assault charges,30,dy136zo,"I worked as a victim advocate for several years, and a large part of my job was serving as the primary point of contact for sexual assault victims during felony criminal proceedings. I was typically in contact with them at or before the point they filed their initial police reports, accompanied them to hearings and trials, and in some cases remained in contact with them long after the cases were settled.

I can tell you that for the vast majority, that moment of validation is unfortunately a fleeting one. In some ways, working toward the day you can tell your story and bring your abuser to justice acts as a placeholder for addressing the deeper emotional and psychological damage. The support structure of family and friends begins to erode, because people on the outside tend to equate ""justice served"" with ""problem solved."" They're suddenly not being asked how they're doing, what they're feeling, or what they need on a regular basis, and some don't have the means or the desire to pursue therapy as a means of coping. For a lot of victims, it leads to total emotional and/or mental collapse within a matter of weeks or months.

And even once they get past that stage, get help, move on with their lives...it's not over. About 1/3 of the way through the prison sentence, the victim starts getting letters. Letters from the parole board notifying them of an upcoming early release hearing, sometimes requesting their input on whether parole should be granted. Even though the first parole application in cases like this is traditionally a rubber stamp rejection, it gets the victim thinking about the day their abuser will be released. It instills a sense of dread. Suddenly they're back to obsessing over their abuser, counting the days until the next hearing. Often they'll entertain uprooting their entire lives, leaving their jobs and loved ones behind to get as far away as possible by the time of release. And once the release inevitably comes, no matter how far away they've run, they can look forward to a lifetime of looking over their shoulders in fear that their abuser will come for vengeance.

The effects of sexual abuse never leave a person. If it happens to you, no matter how strong you become or how well you cope, you will be re\-victimized again and again for the rest of your life. If you know someone who was a victim of sexual abuse, please never forget that. They need your support and encouragement long after they stop asking for it.",0

 Plaintiff: Okay. Well, we got back from Home Depot and I made a joke, saying, ""What time does your wife come home? We have a couple minutes."" And next thing I know, that's what happened. So I was like, you know, I wasn't planning on having sex with him. So, you know what I mean? 

Respondent: No, I don't. 

Plaintiff: I don't know how to make it any clearer. I -- we had sex, but it was against my will. I wasn't planning on having sex with him. So he was like -- we were standing in the kitchen and he pulled my pants down, and that's what happened.    


Plaintiff: Okay. So I made a joke, like, ""What time does your wife come home?"" And next thing I know he was like, you know, grabbing at my clothes, pulling, you know, pulling my pants down. So I was like, you know, I didn't wanna have sex with him and it happened. And I was like, ""You know what, that was against my will."" And he's like, ""Well, you liked it; didn't you?"" I was like, you know, that's what happened.

Respondent: Did you tell him to stop? 

Plaintiff: Yeah. Yeah, I did. I was like, ""Stop. Get off me,"" and he's like, ""Oh, come on, come on,"" and he just didn't stop. 

Respondent: Okay.

 Defense counsel: Would it be fair to say . . . that you are capable of asserting yourself against unwanted sexual advances? 

Plaintiff: I guess so. I don't really know. 

Respondent: I'm sorry, but, ""I guess so,"" is not an answer. Do you understand the question? 

Plaintiff: Not really, I don't understand the question. 

Respondent: I'll ask the question then. 

Plaintiff: Okay. 

Respondent: Do you know how to stop somebody from having intercourse with you? 

Plaintiff: Yes.  

 Respondent: How would you do that? 

Plaintiff: I'd probably physically harm them somehow. 

Respondent: Short of physically harming them? 

Plaintiff: Tell them no. 

Respondent: Tell them no. What else? 

Plaintiff: To stop.

 Respondent: To stop. What else? 

Plaintiff: And to run away or try to get away. 

Respondent: Run away, get away. Anything else? 

Plaintiff: I -- that's all I know. 

Respondent: Block your body parts? 

Plaintiff: Yeah. 

Respondent: Close your legs? Call the police? Did you do any of those things?

https://www.njcourts.gov/attorneys/assets/acjc/RussoComplaint.pdf  
> Defendant Alfio Carbonetto failed to comply with the PSA, which led to the filing of several applications for spousal support and arrears by Plaintiff Celestina Carbonetto.  
On October 30, 2015, the Honorable Steven F. Nemeth, J.S.C. entered an Order denying Mr. Carbonetto's various applications with respect to his spousal support obligation and arrears and granted Mrs. Carbonetto' s applications with respect to enforcement. A bench wanant for the arrest and incarceration of Mr. Carbonetto was to issue at 11:00 AM on November 13, 2015 for his failure to pay $10,000.00 in support arrears.  
On March 9, 2016, Mr. Carbonetto was brought before Respondent (Shithead judge) on that bench warrant. Mrs. Carbonetto was not present.  
RESPONDENT (Shithead judge): For the record, I've known Al Carbonetto and his wife since high school. Tina Bizzucci at that point. We haven't really kept up. I don't believe I have a conflict in this matter.  
MR. CARBONETTO: No, I don't believe so.  
RESPONDENT: Although I reserve the right to recuse myself because of the nature of the relationship of both me and your ex-wife.  
RESPONDENT: I need to conduct a hearing as to indigency. I'm going to ask questions and I urge you just to answer the questions I'm asking. When was the last time you·were gainfully employed?  
MR. CARBONETTO: When I had my pizza shop in September 2014.  
RESPONDENT: Al's Pizza? You sold that business?  
MR. CARBONETTO: No, we got evicted by the Stella family, the owner. Someone came and took the lease over.  
RESPONDENT: Al's Pizza? You didn't sell the business? You got evicted?  
MR. CARBONETTO: Yes.  
RESPONDENT: By the way, it's not as good.  
MR. CARBONETTO: Thank you, Your Honor. 
  

He then proceeded to drop Mr. Carbonetto's alimony purge arrears from $10,000 to **$300** and also vacated the warrant Judge Nemeth issued. Supposedly he was impartial and not a conflict of interest.

Judge Who Advised Woman to 'Close Your Legs' to Avoid Sexual Assault Permanently Removed From the Bench,14,fs0esgj,"I hate how a bunch of people are defending the judge under this comment and saying that he was just trying ""to establish the flow of events"" or some shit like that. 

Firstly, he asks her what happened and she responds, maybe not the most articulately, but she states in her own view what happened. That's almost always a starting point for gathering evidence. That's why there's the common phrase ""describe what happened   in your own words"". You ask that, they respond, then you immediately move on to ask further clarifying questions to get more detail from the incident. Instead of doing this after the plaintiff told her side of the story, he immediately criticized her telling of the story and insisted that she hadn't informed him of what had happened. It was very unprofessional for him to say that after she had just given him a brief description of what happened. She repeated herself three times before he moved on to asking further questions, which would obviously make her feel as though she was not being listened to or believed. 

Then instead of asking her what actions she took to defend herself, he asks her ""Do you know how to stop somebody from having intercourse with you?"". This is probably the worse thing he says, worse than ""did she shut her legs"" because this is an extremely unclear and unprofessional question to ask in the courtroom as it has no obvious answer. It's a leading question and seems intended purely to trip the plaintiff up. A person, for instance could have knowledge of actions that might prevent them from being raped, but not have taken any of those actions in the moment. And also, does any one really know how to stop somebody from raping them? No one really knows a sureproof method of stopping themselves from getting raped that will work in every scenario. As such it has little bearing on the case whether the defendant ""knows"" how to stop a rape. A more appropriate question to ask would be ""Did you take any actions in an effort to prevent the defendant from having intercourse with you?"", and then allow the plaintiff to answer that question. Instead he just goes on asking her to list things she knows how to do to stop rape. This seems to be an effort to undermine her story by making her state everything she knows she should do, and then later being able to use that against her, for instance saying ""You mentioned that you knew that so and so was an option to prevent rape, how come you didn't do that to prevent him from raping you?""

Then after he continuously asks ""What else"" are options to prevent her from being raped, he starts adding options --- block your body parts, close your legs, call the police. The ""did you do any of those things?"" definitely comes off as disparaging, especially when as soon as she tries to answer, he interrupts her, which is again very unprofessional for a judge to cut off a witness. Listing three questions in a row, then not bothering to fully listen to the answer, smh. Also the courts don't usually use ""did you do any of the above"" questions. They want a specific answer to each detail of the question, so asking a question like ""Did you steal your brother's pen? Did you steal your brother's house?"" at the same time displays a desire to slant the answer. Either way the judge asking the witness if she closed her legs as an option to stop the rape also seems highly unprofessional as if closing her legs was an option she should have used to stop the rape. The ""Did you do any of these things"" implies that she did nothing or at least not enough to prevent herself from being raped.

From looking at this transcript, it definitely feels like the judge was basically doing the prosecutors' job of trying to entrap the witness (not that the prosecutor should have asked those kind of questions either), rather than being an impartial gatherer of information.",1

Resistance isn't required only an absence of freely given consent which the plaintiff had already established by saying the sex was against her will and that she told the defendant to get off.

actually, in cases of District Court Judges like this that’s probably not what you’re looking at.  

There has been a decent amount of academic research into this, although most of it was done decades ago.

Specifically, when looking at district/local level judges what you are seeing is selection bias.

Power didn’t go to their heads and fuck them up. They had fucked up heads already and sought out a job that gave them life or death power over helpless others.

—-

Both in studies about authoritarian personality and studies about sociopathy/psychopathy it has been shown that people in those groups (which have some overlap but are not at all the same issue) are radically over represented at the lowest level of the judicial system.  

(Other groups this applies to: school principles, gym teachers, high school coaches, police & sherrifs, CEOs, prison wardens— & I’m probably forgetting a couple).

But, other than cops, district judges score the worst on these tests.

I remember one study from college that found that district judges reported having been regularly beaten as children by their parents at some insane rate compared to the general population (like >10x).

The judge takes a minute introduces himself since it was the first time we were in that courtroom for the summer. He asks us what we thought about the hearing etc. then says,

“Now you tell me if I’m being to cynical madams clerk. But we all know she’ll be back next year more than likely pregnant, on drugs, or she’ll already be dead.”

This was about a 14 year old  the judge just heard numerous counselors etc. tell the him she was keeping up with her court ordered therapy etc. and was doing everything right.  She was only there in the first place for getting in a fight at school after being bullied for months. 

That or the time a judge told several people in our office at once since a few of us were watching a trial that she couldn’t believe we were having a full jury trial for this case and she blamed the public defender’s officer for not trying to work things out with the prosecutor in advance. (She was pissed she had 3 trials scheduled that week).

Problem is that with it being open it normalizes the behavior, which I think generates more racists by perpetuating and fostering hatred in people who, if otherwise left un-exposed to normalized racism, would have found other outlets for their own misery and need to find blame for the shiftiness in their own lives.

You see it in online communities.  They start with off-color jokes.  Maybe some mild race-baiting but it's just a joke man, don't get so worked up! 

Normalize that and the next step is complaining about *Them* and *They* doing.something shitty.  Maybe a specific instance of one of *them* at first, but then it becomes a generalization.

Then trickles in some hard racism masked behind pseudo-intellectualism.  Articles, podcasts, ""research"" all justifying the animosity towards *Them*.  You have to be an idiot not to see it!

Then comes the in-person meetups.  Maybe a rally or two.  Who's standing up for *Us* if *They* are always in the limelight?

And then you get into confrontations with *Them* - you'd been arguing online with *Them* and their moronic supporters for months, but now you've met counter-protesters in person and every stereotype just clicks info place.  These ignorant, vulgar, unkempt *Them* screaming their intolerance in your face.  The nerve!

And before you know it you are carrying tiki torches screaming that ""*They* won't replace us!"", and being proud of it.

He was conservative but his views seemed based in a genuine desire for everyone to do better. We didn't necessarily agree but I respected the hell out of him.

After Obama was elected he kinda spiraled. He started making racist jokes and while I have a pretty twisted sense of humor his jokes grew meaner and more frequent. Eventually they weren't jokes. He became combative to anyone that wasn't a few degrees right of Limbaugh. He bought into every conspiracy theory regarding democrats, scientific institutions and especially President Obama. 

About his time his health started rapidly declining and he became unable to work. This proud man who'd always supported himself, found himself collecting a government check.

His disease was definitely attacking his intellectual ability but it was much more than that: he harbored passionate hatred for anyone that was even a little different.

And those questions were just for a protection order? What the hell, man. ""Did you give the defendant consent to engage in sexual intercourse with you?""/""Did you attempt to resist, physically or otherwise?"" would have been more than sufficient, lol.

Dude fucked up, got canned for the fuckup. Seems fair to me. Judges are just human, sure, but they should still be held to a higher standard of accountability. Just like police, or anyone else who has a say in the life/freedom of another person.",0
Judge Who Advised Woman to 'Close Your Legs' to Avoid Sexual Assault Permanently Removed From the Bench,12,frxza3r,"They have a different process, yes, but protective orders have a much lower threshold for them to be granted against someone in comparison to being convicted of a specific crime. The goal of a protective order is not establishing guilt of assault, sexual or physical, but to determine if the plaintiff should be granted a protective order because they have a reasonable fear of the defendant harming them. 

I've worked with multiple domestic violence victims who obtained protective orders, and telling the judge what happened and when plus why this person continues to present a danger that you need a protective order for should be all you need to do. The judge will ask questions to clarify or for further explanation when they need to, but they are not supposed to be assessing whether they think that person really did assault you.

If anything, the fact that this was a protective order hearing makes this a million times worse to me. The process of getting a protective order is often already frightening and confusing for many victims who are recently traumatized; being treated by this like a judge is not appropriate and reinforces the trend of people being afraid to seek help from the courts. This judge's attitude has no place in a system designed to provide legal protection to victims.",0
Judge Who Advised Woman to 'Close Your Legs' to Avoid Sexual Assault Permanently Removed From the Bench,3,fs15ssx,"Okay I'm glad someone else said this. One of the times I was on Jury duty not only did the judge ask questions he also stopped both the defense and the prosecution several times.

He explained himself by saying something along the lines of ""I know this many seem unusual to you because neither side is objecting but if the law isn't being observed I will stop things."" or something like that.

I believe this is related to what /u/Pippineddu is saying

Judge Who Advised Woman to 'Close Your Legs' to Avoid Sexual Assault Permanently Removed From the Bench,18,frxwj48,"""how she tried to stop it""

Let's explore this thought process a bit. How do people think other people stop rape? They presume that the victim cries out, yells, punches, runs away and calls the police. 

In reality, crying out, yelling and fighting back, in practice, may result in the victim being violently sexually assaulted as opposed to sexually assaulted. ""May"" is not qualified. Is it a 50% chance? 100% chance? 1% chance? That probability is instinctively assessed while they're being sexually assaulted - which is not a rational/logical time to start calculating probabilities. 

Also, both men and women are shy to report because of the social mental and legal repercussions. No rape victim wants to be asked, ""Well, did you close your legs? Were you wearing sexually suggestive clothing? Why didn't you punch him and run away?"" 

Victim blaming, 100%. 

People need to talk to victims of assault more to understand that it's not an input-output situation. Nobody is like, ""oh, this person seems to be trying to rape me, I should politely bail""; they are more like, ""....what... what... what... um. what... I need to go... let me go... please let me go... I don't want trouble... is this really happening? ... I'm going to go."" When you're faced with inexplicable behaviour (attempted rape), people do not react ""logically"" and even if they do, it doesn't always result in a favourable outcome.

As for why it was an inappropriate question from the judge, imagine if someone stabbed you on the street and the judge asked you 'well if you didn't want to be stabbed why didn't you just tense your abs and deflect the knife?'

And by that I mean a person who has become bored with simply being wealthy and decided that they’d like to try being powerful, too. 

This country has been promised all sorts of shit over the past few decades that hasn’t come to fruition, regardless of which side of the spectrum those things would satisfy and despite each side having ample opportunity to do so when controlling both houses of Congress and the White House.

Joe Biden selects Kamala Harris as his running mate,29,g15eqte,"Getting out the way that both are very qualified and I have no doubt that either could have served in the office competently and well...

Partly because of name recognition - Harris is comparatively well known because of her run to be candidate. That means less work informing the public who she is, given that typical campaign patterns have been thrown off by the pandemic. 

Partly because she's from a state that hasn't had a republican senator since 1992, compared to Duckworth in Illinois who defeated an incumbent republican senator in 2016. Both will up for reelection in 2020, and incumbency advantage might be helpful in Illinois (admittedly both are democratic strongholds and this is a dems friendly environment) .

Partly because Harris ran for nominee, and it's typical for VPs to run from president later - 75% since WWII. Given Biden's age, more than just his campaign will be thinking about 2024.

Partly because an idiot friend of Biden, Dodd, suggested that she hadn't been conciliatory enough after criticising him on racial issues in the primary, and it is *not* a good look to even hint that a Black woman was rejected from consideration because she was too strident or undefererential on race matters.

And partly because she's mixed race Black and South Asian. The Biden campaign is trying to maximise its appeal in a racially fraught national environment. There are questions about Biden's handling of race. Police brutality against Black people is a hugely visible topic and point of protest. The sitting president is widely considered racist by the public. White people are becoming more invested in and supportive of racial equality. Asian voters have in recent years skewed democrat and Biden may be wanting to maintain/ increase those levels (though obviously not all Asians are Indian, and being racially represented on a ballot does not guarantee a vote for that ballot). Both Duckworth and Harris are women of colour, and both represent targets for Trump's vitriol, so I'm not convinced that Harris being Black would make much difference to him.

Edit to add:

Biden also owes a lot to party elites, especially Clyburn. Biden was in trouble until South Carolina, and Clyburn's endorsement was important to his success. Clyburn called for Biden to choose a Black woman as running mate, and the implication was fairly clear that he meant to suggest Harris without explicitly dictating the VP pick. Biden doesn't want to piss off any party elites, especially those who might have an impact on turnout through community ties, and especially ones that had a large part to play in his comeback and subsequent success.",0

I do think there's some question as to whether the debates really even matter, given that Clinton and Kerry destroyed Trump and GWB respectively in the debates, and it didn't matter. I also think it's reasonable, based on Biden's campaign to this point, to wonder if he's still cognitively able to debate at the level he did 12 years ago. 

That's the lesser issue though, since even a fullblown senile person could school Trump in a debate where things like facts matter at all. We just all gotta recognize that there's literally nothing Biden can do in any debate that will swing Republican votes. The best you can really hope for is that Biden manages to inspire and turn out an especially large number of Democrats, and maybe that Trump finally says whatever magically unique stupidity that would actually cost him Republican support.

Many people didn't vote because they didn't like Clinton but felt safe not doing so because there was no way Trump would win--they could afford to make their statement by refusing to vote for Clinton.

But here we are. He won. And if republicans put forward someone even worse than Trump in the future and we're not paying attention... it could happen again.

This is your answer. Censorship might be an interesting story but won't get nearly the views as an article on sexism on the internet. Most people outside of reddit don't care about the internal debate over freedom of speech vs morality.

There was no evidence or claim that she was directly responsible for that incident at all and yet the protest/response was quickly consumed by people focusing all their frustration at Pao specifically.

I hadn't considered that this was her intended role in the first place, but now that you mention it I even wonder if some of the more dominant anti-Pao posts were actually astro-turfing to manipulate the dialogue from both sides.

A bit of a geeky reference, but as an example I think back to when D.C. was doing the Batman Incorporated storyline and Bruce Wayne came out publicly as funding Batman's vigilantism. Afterwards in the comics run you could see glimpses of him on the batcomputer taking part in internet debates on whether Bruce Wayne was Batman, with Batman himself controlling multiple accounts and arguing on both sides of the issue in order to manipulate the entire discussion.

Like people have already pointed out, sure one ceo got swapped for an old one but there has been no commitment made to any actual change in policy and yet the issue is almost certainly finished in any meaningful degree. A brilliant tactic if you are planning to implement goal changes that you know will receive a loud, public backlash.

I'm not saying that this is what you're doing by any means, but Ive had a thought brewing for a while that your post seemed to help solidify. 

I have people in my family who might be considered bigoted in some parts of the country. I used to confront these people with what could be considered vitriol under the assumption that believing what they did was detrimental to society, and more importantly that they were consciously choosing an opinion of ignorance. 

While their ideas were certainly ill conceived, attacking them personally achieved nothing. It never would. People are proud. They do not respond to aggressive criticism and it will never help them change their point of view. 

Instead of trying to argue a stance, I eventually found myself just asking questions. 'Why do you believe that? What do you think about this other aspect? If I were to tell you that you can find (X) information here, would you consider reconciling that with your beliefs?'

TLDR - I guess what I'm saying is that I can't get angry for people who haven't spent time forming a nuanced opinion. On any issue. I repeat, any issue. 

We only have so much time and energy to learn, and it accomplishes nothing to blame someone personally for having incomplete information. Instead, I try to share what I know in the hopes that positive communication and a sincerity to share and  teach will affect change.
